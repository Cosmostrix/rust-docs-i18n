<h1>The Unstable Book</h1>
<br>
<p>Welcome to the Unstable Book! This book consists of a number of chapters,
each one organized by a &quot;feature flag.&quot; That is, when using an unstable
feature of Rust, you must use a flag, like this:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="#![feature(box_syntax)]"></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="fn main() {"></div><div data-l="    let five = box 5;"></div><div data-l="}"></div></div>
<br>
<p>The <code>box_syntax</code> feature <a href="#3box">has a chapter</a> describing how to use it.</p>
<br>
<a class="notranslate" href="#1language-features/box-syntax.html">box</a>
<br>
<p>Because this documentation relates to unstable features, we make no guarantees
that what is contained here is accurate or up to date. It's developed on a
best-effort basis. Each page will have a link to its tracking issue with the
latest developments; you might want to check those as well.</p>
