<br>
<p>The tracking issue for this feature is: None.</p>
<br>
<p>------------------------</p>
<br>
<p>This feature is required to link to the <code>compiler_builtins</code> crate which contains
&quot;compiler intrinsics&quot;. Compiler intrinsics are software implementations of basic
operations like multiplication of <code>u64</code>s. These intrinsics are only required on
platforms where these operations don't directly map to a hardware instruction.</p>
<br>
<p>You should never need to explicitly link to the <code>compiler_builtins</code> crate when
building &quot;std&quot; programs as <code>compiler_builtins</code> is already in the dependency
graph of <code>std</code>. But you may need it when building <code>no_std</code> <b>binary</b> crates. If
you get a <i>linker</i> error like:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang=" text"><div data-l="$PWD/src/main.rs:11: undefined reference to `__aeabi_lmul'"></div><div data-l="$PWD/src/main.rs:11: undefined reference to `__aeabi_uldivmod'"></div></div>
<br>
<p>That means that you need to link to this crate.</p>
<br>
<p>When you link to this crate, make sure it only appears once in your crate
dependency graph. Also, it doesn't matter where in the dependency graph you
place the <code>compiler_builtins</code> crate.</p>
<br>
<p><!-- NOTE(ignore) doctests don't support `no_std` binaries --></p>
