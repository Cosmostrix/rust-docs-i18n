<p>------------------------</p>
<br>
<p>Sometimes you want the memory for one collection to use a different
allocator than the memory for another collection. In this case,
replacing the global allocator is not a workable option. Instead,
you need to pass in an instance of an <code>Alloc</code> to each collection
for which you want a custom allocator.</p>
