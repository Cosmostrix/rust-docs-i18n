<br>
<p>The <code>doc_masked</code> feature allows a crate to exclude types from a given crate from appearing in lists
of trait implementations. The specifics of the feature are as follows:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="1.">When rustdoc encounters an <code>extern crate</code> statement annotated with a <code>#[doc(masked)]</code> attribute,
 it marks the crate as being masked.</div>
<br>
<div data-b="2.">When listing traits a given type implements, rustdoc ensures that traits from masked crates are
 not emitted into the documentation.</div>
<br>
<div data-b="3.">When listing types that implement a given trait, rustdoc ensures that types from masked crates
 are not emitted into the documentation.</div>
<br>
<p>This feature was introduced in PR <a class="notranslate" href="#4#44026">#44026</a> to ensure that compiler-internal and
implementation-specific types and traits were not included in the standard library's documentation.
Such types would introduce broken links into the documentation.</p>
