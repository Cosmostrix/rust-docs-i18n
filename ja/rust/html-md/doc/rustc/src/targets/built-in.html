<h1>Built-in Targets</h1>
<br>
<p><code>rustc</code> ships with the ability to compile to many targets automatically, we
call these &quot;built-in&quot; targets, and they generally correspond to targets that
the team is supporting directly.</p>
<br>
<p>To see the list of built-in targets, you can run <code>rustc --print target-list</code>,
or look at <a href="#2https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/nightly-rustc/rustc_back/target/#modules">the API
docs</a>.
Each module there defines a builder for a particular target.</p>
