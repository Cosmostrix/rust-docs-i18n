<h1>Aliasing</h1>
<br>
<p>First off, let's get some important caveats out of this way:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="*">We will be using the broadest possible definition of aliasing for the sake</div>
<p>of discussion. Rust's definition will probably be more restricted to factor
in mutations and liveness.</p>
<br>
<div data-b="*">We will be assuming a single-threaded, interrupt-free, execution. We will also</div>
<p>be ignoring things like memory-mapped hardware. Rust assumes these things
don't happen unless you tell it otherwise. For more details, see the
<a href="#2concurrency.html">Concurrency Chapter</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>With that said, here's our working definition: variables and pointers <i>alias</i>
if they refer to overlapping regions of memory.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Why Aliasing Matters</h1>
<br>
<p>So why should we care about aliasing?</p>
<br>
<p>Consider this simple function:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="fn compute(input: &amp;u32, output: &amp;mut u32) {"></div><div data-l="    if *input &gt; 10 {"></div><div data-l="        *output = 1;"></div><div data-l="    }"></div><div data-l="    if *input &gt; 5 {"></div><div data-l="        *output *= 2;"></div><div data-l="    }"></div><div data-l="}"></div></div>
<br>
<p>We would <i>like</i> to be able to optimize it to the following function:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="fn compute(input: &amp;u32, output: &amp;mut u32) {"></div><div data-l="#//    let cached_input = *input; // keep *input in a register"></div><div data-l="    let cached_input = *input; // ">keep *input in a register</div><div data-l="    if cached_input &gt; 10 {"></div><div data-l="#//        *output = 2;  // x &gt; 10 implies x &gt; 5, so double and exit immediately"></div><div data-l="        *output = 2;  // ">x &gt; 10 implies x &gt; 5, so double and exit immediately</div><div data-l="    } else if cached_input &gt; 5 {"></div><div data-l="        *output *= 2;"></div><div data-l="    }"></div><div data-l="}"></div></div>
<br>
<p>In Rust, this optimization should be sound. For almost any other language, it
wouldn't be (barring global analysis). This is because the optimization relies
on knowing that aliasing doesn't occur, which most languages are fairly liberal
with. Specifically, we need to worry about function arguments that make <code>input</code>
and <code>output</code> overlap, such as <code>compute(&amp;x, &amp;mut x)</code>.</p>
<br>
<p>With that input, we could get this execution:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust,ignore"><div data-l="#                    //  input ==  output == 0xabad1dea"></div><div data-l="#                    // *input == *output == 20"></div><div data-l="                    // "> input ==  output == 0xabad1dea <i>input == </i>output == 20</div><div data-l="#//if *input &gt; 10 {    // true  (*input == 20)"></div><div data-l="if *input &gt; 10 {    // ">true  (*input == 20)</div><div data-l="#//    *output = 1;    // also overwrites *input, because they are the same"></div><div data-l="    *output = 1;    // ">also overwrites *input, because they are the same</div><div data-l="}"></div><div data-l="#//if *input &gt; 5 {     // false (*input == 1)"></div><div data-l="if *input &gt; 5 {     // ">false (*input == 1)</div><div data-l="    *output *= 2;"></div><div data-l="}"></div><div data-l="#                    // *input == *output == 1"></div><div data-l="                    // "><i>input == </i>output == 1</div></div>
<br>
<p>Our optimized function would produce <code>*output == 2</code> for this input, so the
correctness of our optimization relies on this input being impossible.</p>
<br>
<p>In Rust we know this input should be impossible because <code>&amp;mut</code> isn't allowed to be
aliased. So we can safely reject its possibility and perform this optimization.
In most other languages, this input would be entirely possible, and must be considered.</p>
<br>
<p>This is why alias analysis is important: it lets the compiler perform useful
optimizations! Some examples:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="*">keeping values in registers by proving no pointers access the value's memory</div>
<div data-b="*">eliminating reads by proving some memory hasn't been written to since last we read it</div>
<div data-b="*">eliminating writes by proving some memory is never read before the next write to it</div>
<div data-b="*">moving or reordering reads and writes by proving they don't depend on each other</div>
<br>
<p>These optimizations also tend to prove the soundness of bigger optimizations
such as loop vectorization, constant propagation, and dead code elimination.</p>
<br>
<p>In the previous example, we used the fact that <code>&amp;mut u32</code> can't be aliased to prove
that writes to <code>*output</code> can't possibly affect <code>*input</code>. This let us cache <code>*input</code>
in a register, eliminating a read.</p>
<br>
<p>By caching this read, we knew that the the write in the <code>&gt; 10</code> branch couldn't
affect whether we take the <code>&gt; 5</code> branch, allowing us to also eliminate a
read-modify-write (doubling <code>*output</code>) when <code>*input &gt; 10</code>.</p>
<br>
<p>The key thing to remember about alias analysis is that writes are the primary
hazard for optimizations. That is, the only thing that prevents us
from moving a read to any other part of the program is the possibility of us
re-ordering it with a write to the same location.</p>
<br>
<p>For instance, we have no concern for aliasing in the following modified version
of our function, because we've moved the only write to <code>*output</code> to the very
end of our function. This allows us to freely reorder the reads of <code>*input</code> that
occur before it:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="fn compute(input: &amp;u32, output: &amp;mut u32) {"></div><div data-l="    let mut temp = *output;"></div><div data-l="    if *input &gt; 10 {"></div><div data-l="        temp = 1;"></div><div data-l="    }"></div><div data-l="    if *input &gt; 5 {"></div><div data-l="        temp *= 2;"></div><div data-l="    }"></div><div data-l="    *output = temp;"></div><div data-l="}"></div></div>
<br>
<p>We're still relying on alias analysis to assume that <code>temp</code> doesn't alias
<code>input</code>, but the proof is much simpler: the value of a local variable can't be
aliased by things that existed before it was declared. This is an assumption
every language freely makes, and so this version of the function could be
optimized the way we want in any language.</p>
<br>
<p>This is why the definition of &quot;alias&quot; that Rust will use likely involves some
notion of liveness and mutation: we don't actually care if aliasing occurs if
there aren't any actual writes to memory happening.</p>
<br>
<p>Of course, a full aliasing model for Rust must also take into consideration things like
function calls (which may mutate things we don't see), raw pointers (which have
no aliasing requirements on their own), and UnsafeCell (which lets the referent
of an <code>&amp;</code> be mutated).</p>
