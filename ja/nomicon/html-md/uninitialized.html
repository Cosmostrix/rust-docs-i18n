<h1>Working With Uninitialized Memory</h1>
<br>
<p>All runtime-allocated memory in a Rust program begins its life as
<i>uninitialized</i>. In this state the value of the memory is an indeterminate pile
of bits that may or may not even reflect a valid state for the type that is
supposed to inhabit that location of memory. Attempting to interpret this memory
as a value of <i>any</i> type will cause Undefined Behavior. Do Not Do This.</p>
<br>
<p>Rust provides mechanisms to work with uninitialized memory in checked (safe) and
unchecked (unsafe) ways.</p>
