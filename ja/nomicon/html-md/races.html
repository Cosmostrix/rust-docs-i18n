<h1>Data Races and Race Conditions</h1>
<br>
<p>Safe Rust guarantees an absence of data races, which are defined as:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="*">two or more threads concurrently accessing a location of memory</div>
<div data-b="*">one of them is a write</div>
<div data-b="*">one of them is unsynchronized</div>
<br>
<p>A data race has Undefined Behavior, and is therefore impossible to perform
in Safe Rust. Data races are <i>mostly</i> prevented through rust's ownership system:
it's impossible to alias a mutable reference, so it's impossible to perform a
data race. Interior mutability makes this more complicated, which is largely why
we have the Send and Sync traits (see below).</p>
<br>
<p><b>However Rust does not prevent general race conditions.</b></p>
<br>
<p>This is pretty fundamentally impossible, and probably honestly undesirable. Your
hardware is racy, your OS is racy, the other programs on your computer are racy,
and the world this all runs in is racy. Any system that could genuinely claim to
prevent <i>all</i> race conditions would be pretty awful to use, if not just
incorrect.</p>
<br>
<p>So it's perfectly &quot;fine&quot; for a Safe Rust program to get deadlocked or do
something nonsensical with incorrect synchronization. Obviously such a program
isn't very good, but Rust can only hold your hand so far. Still, a race
condition can't violate memory safety in a Rust program on its own. Only in
conjunction with some other unsafe code can a race condition actually violate
memory safety. For instance:</p>
