<h1>Drop Flags</h1>
<br>
<p>The examples in the previous section introduce an interesting problem for Rust.
We have seen that it's possible to conditionally initialize, deinitialize, and
reinitialize locations of memory totally safely. For Copy types, this isn't
particularly notable since they're just a random pile of bits. However types
with destructors are a different story: Rust needs to know whether to call a
destructor whenever a variable is assigned to, or a variable goes out of scope.
How can it do this with conditional initialization?</p>
<br>
<p>Note that this is not a problem that all assignments need worry about. In
particular, assigning through a dereference unconditionally drops, and assigning
in a <code>let</code> unconditionally doesn't drop:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang=""><div data-l="#//let mut x = Box::new(0); // let makes a fresh variable, so never need to drop"></div><div data-l="let mut x = Box::new(0); // ">let makes a fresh variable, so never need to drop</div><div data-l="let y = &amp;mut x;"></div><div data-l="#//*y = Box::new(1); // Deref assumes the referent is initialized, so always drops"></div><div data-l="*y = Box::new(1); // ">Deref assumes the referent is initialized, so always drops</div></div>
<br>
<p>This is only a problem when overwriting a previously initialized variable or
one of its subfields.</p>
<br>
<p>It turns out that Rust actually tracks whether a type should be dropped or not
<i>at runtime</i>. As a variable becomes initialized and uninitialized, a <i>drop flag</i>
for that variable is toggled. When a variable might need to be dropped, this
flag is evaluated to determine if it should be dropped.</p>
<br>
<p>Of course, it is often the case that a value's initialization state can be
statically known at every point in the program. If this is the case, then the
compiler can theoretically generate more efficient code! For instance, straight-
line code has such <i>static drop semantics</i>:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="#//let mut x = Box::new(0); // x was uninit; just overwrite."></div><div data-l="let mut x = Box::new(0); // ">x was uninit; just overwrite.</div><div data-l="#//let mut y = x;           // y was uninit; just overwrite and make x uninit."></div><div data-l="let mut y = x;           // ">y was uninit; just overwrite and make x uninit.</div><div data-l="#//x = Box::new(0);         // x was uninit; just overwrite."></div><div data-l="x = Box::new(0);         // ">x was uninit; just overwrite.</div><div data-l="#//y = x;                   // y was init; Drop y, overwrite it, and make x uninit!"></div><div data-l="#                         // y goes out of scope; y was init; Drop y!"></div><div data-l="#                         // x goes out of scope; x was uninit; do nothing."></div><div data-l="y = x;                   // ">y was init; Drop y, overwrite it, and make x uninit! y goes out of scope; y was init; Drop y! x goes out of scope; x was uninit; do nothing.</div></div>
<br>
<p>Similarly, branched code where all branches have the same behavior with respect
to initialization has static drop semantics:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="# let condition = true;"></div><div data-l="#//let mut x = Box::new(0);    // x was uninit; just overwrite."></div><div data-l="let mut x = Box::new(0);    // ">x was uninit; just overwrite.</div><div data-l="if condition {"></div><div data-l="#//    drop(x)                 // x gets moved out; make x uninit."></div><div data-l="    drop(x)                 // ">x gets moved out; make x uninit.</div><div data-l="} else {"></div><div data-l="    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, x);"></div><div data-l="#//    drop(x)                 // x gets moved out; make x uninit."></div><div data-l="    drop(x)                 // ">x gets moved out; make x uninit.</div><div data-l="}"></div><div data-l="#//x = Box::new(0);            // x was uninit; just overwrite."></div><div data-l="#                            // x goes out of scope; x was init; Drop x!"></div><div data-l="x = Box::new(0);            // ">x was uninit; just overwrite. x goes out of scope; x was init; Drop x!</div></div>
<br>
<p>However code like this <i>requires</i> runtime information to correctly Drop:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="# let condition = true;"></div><div data-l="let x;"></div><div data-l="if condition {"></div><div data-l="#//    x = Box::new(0);        // x was uninit; just overwrite."></div><div data-l="    x = Box::new(0);        // ">x was uninit; just overwrite.</div><div data-l="    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, x);"></div><div data-l="}"></div><div data-l="#                            // x goes out of scope; x might be uninit;"></div><div data-l="#                            // check the flag!"></div><div data-l="                            // ">x goes out of scope; x might be uninit; check the flag!</div></div>
<br>
<p>Of course, in this case it's trivial to retrieve static drop semantics:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="# let condition = true;"></div><div data-l="if condition {"></div><div data-l="    let x = Box::new(0);"></div><div data-l="    println!(&quot;{}&quot;, x);"></div><div data-l="}"></div></div>
<br>
<p>The drop flags are tracked on the stack and no longer stashed in types that
implement drop.</p>
