<h1>What Unsafe Rust Can Do</h1>
<br>
<p>The only things that are different in Unsafe Rust are that you can:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="*">Dereference raw pointers</div>
<div data-b="*">Call <code>unsafe</code> functions (including C functions, compiler intrinsics, and the raw allocator)</div>
<div data-b="*">Implement <code>unsafe</code> traits</div>
<div data-b="*">Mutate statics</div>
<br>
<p>That's it. The reason these operations are relegated to Unsafe is that misusing
any of these things will cause the ever dreaded Undefined Behavior. Invoking
Undefined Behavior gives the compiler full rights to do arbitrarily bad things
to your program. You definitely <i>should not</i> invoke Undefined Behavior.</p>
<br>
<p>Unlike C, Undefined Behavior is pretty limited in scope in Rust. All the core
language cares about is preventing the following things:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="*">Dereferencing null, dangling, or unaligned pointers</div>
<div data-b="*">Reading <a href="#3">uninitialized memory</a></div>
<div data-b="*">Breaking the <a href="#3">pointer aliasing rules</a></div>
<div data-b="*">Producing invalid primitive values:</div>
<div data-b="    *">dangling/null references</div>
<div data-b="    *">a <code>bool</code> that isn't 0 or 1</div>
<div data-b="    *">an undefined <code>enum</code> discriminant</div>
<div data-b="    *">a <code>char</code> outside the ranges <a class="notranslate" href="#40x0, 0xD7FF">0x0, 0xD7FF</a> and <a class="notranslate" href="#40xE000, 0x10FFFF">0xE000, 0x10FFFF</a></div>
<div data-b="    *">A non-utf8 <code>str</code></div>
<div data-b="*">Unwinding into another language</div>
<div data-b="*">Causing a <a href="#3race">data race</a></div>
<br>
<p>That's it. That's all the causes of Undefined Behavior baked into Rust. Of
course, unsafe functions and traits are free to declare arbitrary other
constraints that a program must maintain to avoid Undefined Behavior. For
instance, the allocator APIs declare that deallocating unallocated memory is
Undefined Behavior.</p>
<br>
<p>However, violations of these constraints generally will just transitively lead to one of
the above problems. Some additional constraints may also derive from compiler
intrinsics that make special assumptions about how code can be optimized. For instance,
Vec and Box make use of intrinsics that require their pointers to be non-null at all times.</p>
<br>
<p>Rust is otherwise quite permissive with respect to other dubious operations.
Rust considers it &quot;safe&quot; to:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="*">Deadlock</div>
<div data-b="*">Have a <a href="#3race">race condition</a></div>
<div data-b="*">Leak memory</div>
<div data-b="*">Fail to call destructors</div>
<div data-b="*">Overflow integers</div>
<div data-b="*">Abort the program</div>
<div data-b="*">Delete the production database</div>
<br>
<p>However any program that actually manages to do such a thing is <i>probably</i>
incorrect. Rust provides lots of tools to make these things rare, but
these problems are considered impractical to categorically prevent.</p>
