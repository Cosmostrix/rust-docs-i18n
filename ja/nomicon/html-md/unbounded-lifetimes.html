<h1>Unbounded Lifetimes</h1>
<br>
<p>Unsafe code can often end up producing references or lifetimes out of thin air.
Such lifetimes come into the world as <i>unbounded</i>. The most common source of this
is dereferencing a raw pointer, which produces a reference with an unbounded lifetime.
Such a lifetime becomes as big as context demands. This is in fact more powerful
than simply becoming <code>'static</code>, because for instance <code>&amp;'static &amp;'a T</code>
will fail to typecheck, but the unbound lifetime will perfectly mold into
<code>&amp;'a &amp;'a T</code> as needed. However for most intents and purposes, such an unbounded
lifetime can be regarded as <code>'static</code>.</p>
<br>
<p>Almost no reference is <code>'static</code>, so this is probably wrong. <code>transmute</code> and
<code>transmute_copy</code> are the two other primary offenders. One should endeavor to
bound an unbounded lifetime as quickly as possible, especially across function
boundaries.</p>
<br>
<p>Given a function, any output lifetimes that don't derive from inputs are
unbounded. For instance:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust,ignore"><div data-l="fn get_str&lt;'a&gt;() -&gt; &amp;'a str;"></div></div>
<br>
<p>will produce an <code>&amp;str</code> with an unbounded lifetime. The easiest way to avoid
unbounded lifetimes is to use lifetime elision at the function boundary.
If an output lifetime is elided, then it <i>must</i> be bounded by an input lifetime.
Of course it might be bounded by the <i>wrong</i> lifetime, but this will usually
just cause a compiler error, rather than allow memory safety to be trivially
violated.</p>
<br>
<p>Within a function, bounding lifetimes is more error-prone. The safest and easiest
way to bound a lifetime is to return it from a function with a bound lifetime.
However if this is unacceptable, the reference can be placed in a location with
a specific lifetime. Unfortunately it's impossible to name all lifetimes involved
in a function.</p>
