<h1>Constructors</h1>
<br>
<p>There is exactly one way to create an instance of a user-defined type: name it,
and initialize all its fields at once:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="struct Foo {"></div><div data-l="    a: u8,"></div><div data-l="    b: u32,"></div><div data-l="    c: bool,"></div><div data-l="}"></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="enum Bar {"></div><div data-l="    X(u32),"></div><div data-l="    Y(bool),"></div><div data-l="}"></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="struct Unit;"></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="let foo = Foo { a: 0, b: 1, c: false };"></div><div data-l="let bar = Bar::X(0);"></div><div data-l="let empty = Unit;"></div></div>
<br>
<p>That's it. Every other way you make an instance of a type is just calling a
totally vanilla function that does some stuff and eventually bottoms out to The
One True Constructor.</p>
<br>
<p>Unlike C++, Rust does not come with a slew of built-in kinds of constructor.
There are no Copy, Default, Assignment, Move, or whatever constructors. The
reasons for this are varied, but it largely boils down to Rust's philosophy of
<i>being explicit</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>Move constructors are meaningless in Rust because we don't enable types to
&quot;care&quot; about their location in memory. Every type must be ready for it to be
blindly memcopied to somewhere else in memory. This means pure on-the-stack-but-
still-movable intrusive linked lists are simply not happening in Rust (safely).</p>
<br>
<p>Assignment and copy constructors similarly don't exist because move semantics
are the only semantics in Rust. At most <code>x = y</code> just moves the bits of y into
the x variable. Rust does provide two facilities for providing C++'s copy-
oriented semantics: <code>Copy</code> and <code>Clone</code>. Clone is our moral equivalent of a copy
constructor, but it's never implicitly invoked. You have to explicitly call
<code>clone</code> on an element you want to be cloned. Copy is a special case of Clone
where the implementation is just &quot;copy the bits&quot;. Copy types <i>are</i> implicitly
cloned whenever they're moved, but because of the definition of Copy this just
means not treating the old copy as uninitialized -- a no-op.</p>
<br>
<p>While Rust provides a <code>Default</code> trait for specifying the moral equivalent of a
default constructor, it's incredibly rare for this trait to be used. This is
because variables <a href="#3uninit">aren't implicitly initialized</a>. Default is basically
only useful for generic programming. In concrete contexts, a type will provide a
static <code>new</code> method for any kind of &quot;default&quot; constructor. This has no relation
to <code>new</code> in other languages and has no special meaning. It's just a naming
convention.</p>

<p>TODO: talk about &quot;placement new&quot;?</p>
