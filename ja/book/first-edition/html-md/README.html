<h1>The Rust Programming Language</h1>
<br>
<p>Welcome! This book will teach you about the <a href="#3rust">Rust Programming Language</a>.
Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed,
and concurrency. It maintains these goals without having a garbage collector,
making it a useful language for a number of use cases other languages aren’t
good at: embedding in other languages, programs with specific space and time
requirements, and writing low-level code, like device drivers and operating
systems. It improves on current languages targeting this space by having a
number of compile-time safety checks that produce no runtime overhead, while
eliminating all data races. Rust also aims to achieve ‘zero-cost abstractions’
even though some of these abstractions feel like those of a high-level language.
Even then, Rust still allows precise control like a low-level language would.</p>
