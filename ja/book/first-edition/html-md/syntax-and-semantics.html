<h1>Syntax and Semantics</h1>
<br>
<p>This chapter breaks Rust down into small chunks, one for each concept.</p>
<br>
<p>If you’d like to learn Rust from the bottom up, reading this in order is a
great way to do that.</p>
<br>
<p>These sections also form a reference for each concept, so if you’re reading
another tutorial and find something confusing, you can find it explained
somewhere in here.</p>
