<h1>Unsafe</h1>
<br>
<p>Rust’s main draw is its powerful static guarantees about behavior. But safety
checks are conservative by nature: there are some programs that are actually
safe, but the compiler is not able to verify this is true. To write these kinds
of programs, we need to tell the compiler to relax its restrictions a bit. For
this, Rust has a keyword, <code>unsafe</code>. Code using <code>unsafe</code> has fewer restrictions
than normal code does.</p>
<br>
<p>Let’s go over the syntax, and then we’ll talk semantics. <code>unsafe</code> is used in
four contexts. The first one is to mark a function as unsafe:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="unsafe fn danger_will_robinson() {"></div><div data-l="#    // Scary stuff..."></div><div data-l="    // ">Scary stuff...</div><div data-l="}"></div></div>
<br>
<p>All functions called from <a class="notranslate" href="#3ffi">FFI</a> must be marked as <code>unsafe</code>, for example.
The second use of <code>unsafe</code> is an unsafe block:</p>
<br>
<a class="notranslate" href="#1ffi.html">ffi</a>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="unsafe {"></div><div data-l="#    // Scary stuff..."></div><div data-l="    // ">Scary stuff...</div><div data-l="}"></div></div>
<br>
<p>The third is for unsafe traits:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="unsafe trait Scary { }"></div></div>
<br>
<p>And the fourth is for <code>impl</code>ementing one of those traits:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="# unsafe trait Scary { }"></div><div data-l="unsafe impl Scary for i32 {}"></div></div>
<br>
<p>It’s important to be able to explicitly delineate code that may have bugs that
cause big problems. If a Rust program segfaults, you can be sure the cause is
related to something marked <code>unsafe</code>.</p>
<br>
<h1>What does ‘safe’ mean?</h1>
<br>
<p>Safe, in the context of Rust, means ‘doesn’t do anything unsafe’. It’s also
important to know that there are certain behaviors that are probably not
desirable in your code, but are expressly <s>not</s> unsafe:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="*">Deadlocks</div>
<div data-b="*">Leaks of memory or other resources</div>
<div data-b="*">Exiting without calling destructors</div>
<div data-b="*">Integer overflow</div>
<br>
<p>Rust cannot prevent all kinds of software problems. Buggy code can and will be
written in Rust. These things aren’t great, but they don’t qualify as <code>unsafe</code>
specifically.</p>
<br>
<p>In addition, the following are all undefined behaviors in Rust, and must be
avoided, even when writing <code>unsafe</code> code:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="*">Data races</div>
<div data-b="*">Dereferencing a NULL/dangling raw pointer</div>
<div data-b="*">Reads of <a class="notranslate" href="#3undef">undef</a> (uninitialized) memory</div>
<div data-b="*">Breaking the <a href="#3aliasing">pointer aliasing rules</a> with raw pointers.</div>
<div data-b="*"><code>&amp;mut T</code> and <code>&amp;T</code> follow LLVM’s scoped <a class="notranslate" href="#3noalias">noalias</a> model, except if
the <code>&amp;T</code> contains an <code>UnsafeCell&lt;U&gt;</code>. Unsafe code must not violate these
aliasing guarantees.</div>
<div data-b="*">Mutating an immutable value/reference without <code>UnsafeCell&lt;U&gt;</code></div>
<div data-b="*">Invoking undefined behavior via compiler intrinsics:</div>
<div data-b="  *">Indexing outside of the bounds of an object with <code>std::ptr::offset</code>
(<code>offset</code> intrinsic), with
the exception of one byte past the end which is permitted.</div>
<div data-b="  *">Using <code>std::ptr::copy_nonoverlapping_memory</code> (<code>memcpy32</code>/<code>memcpy64</code>
intrinsics) on overlapping buffers</div>
<div data-b="*">Invalid values in primitive types, even in private fields/locals:</div>
<div data-b="  *">NULL/dangling references or boxes</div>
<div data-b="  *">A value other than <code>false</code> (0) or <code>true</code> (1) in a <code>bool</code></div>
<div data-b="  *">A discriminant in an <code>enum</code> not included in its type definition</div>
<div data-b="  *">A value in a <code>char</code> which is a surrogate or above <code>char::MAX</code></div>
<div data-b="  *">Non-UTF-8 byte sequences in a <code>str</code></div>
<div data-b="*">Unwinding into Rust from foreign code or unwinding from Rust into foreign
code.</div>

<h1>Unsafe Superpowers</h1>
<br>
<p>In both unsafe functions and unsafe blocks, Rust will let you do three things
that you normally can not do. Just three. Here they are:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="1.">Access or update a <a href="#3static">static mutable variable</a>.</div>
<div data-b="2.">Dereference a raw pointer.</div>
<div data-b="3.">Call unsafe functions. This is the most powerful ability.</div>
<br>
<p>That’s it. It’s important that <code>unsafe</code> does not, for example, ‘turn off the
borrow checker’. Adding <code>unsafe</code> to some random Rust code doesn’t change its
semantics, it won’t start accepting anything. But it will let you write
things that <s>do</s> break some of the rules.</p>
<br>
<p>You will also encounter the <code>unsafe</code> keyword when writing bindings to foreign
(non-Rust) interfaces. You're encouraged to write a safe, native Rust interface
around the methods provided by the library.</p>
<br>
<p>Let’s go over the basic three abilities listed, in order.</p>
<br>
<h2>Access or update a <code>static mut</code></h2>
<br>
<p>Rust has a feature called ‘<code>static mut</code>’ which allows for mutable global state.
Doing so can cause a data race, and as such is inherently not safe. For more
details, see the <a class="notranslate" href="#3static">static</a> section of the book.</p>
<br>
<a class="notranslate" href="#1const-and-static.html#static">static</a>
<br>
<h2>Dereference a raw pointer</h2>
<br>
<p>Raw pointers let you do arbitrary pointer arithmetic, and can cause a number of
different memory safety and security issues. In some senses, the ability to
dereference an arbitrary pointer is one of the most dangerous things you can
do. For more on raw pointers, see <a href="#3rawpointers">their section of the book</a>.</p>
<br>
<a class="notranslate" href="#1raw-pointers.html">rawpointers</a>
<br>
<h2>Call unsafe functions</h2>
<br>
<p>This last ability works with both aspects of <code>unsafe</code>: you can only call
functions marked <code>unsafe</code> from inside an unsafe block.</p>
<br>
<p>This ability is powerful and varied. Rust exposes some <a class="notranslate" href="#3intrinsics">compiler
intrinsics</a> as unsafe functions, and some unsafe functions bypass
safety checks, trading safety for speed.</p>
<br>
<p>I’ll repeat again: even though you <s>can</s> do arbitrary things in unsafe blocks
and functions doesn’t mean you should. The compiler will act as though you’re
upholding its invariants, so be careful!</p>
