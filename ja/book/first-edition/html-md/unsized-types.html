<h1>Unsized Types</h1>
<br>
<p>Most types have a particular size, in bytes, that is knowable at compile time.
For example, an <code>i32</code> is thirty-two bits big, or four bytes. However, there are
some types which are useful to express, but do not have a defined size. These are
called ‘unsized’ or ‘dynamically sized’ types. One example is <code>[T]</code>. This type
represents a certain number of <code>T</code> in sequence. But we don’t know how many
there are, so the size is not known.</p>
<br>
<p>Rust understands a few of these types, but they have some restrictions. There
are three:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="1.">We can only manipulate an instance of an unsized type via a pointer. An
 <code>&amp;[T]</code> works fine, but a <code>[T]</code> does not.</div>
<div data-b="2.">Variables and arguments cannot have dynamically sized types.</div>
<div data-b="3.">Only the last field in a <code>struct</code> may have a dynamically sized type; the
 other fields must not. Enum variants must not have dynamically sized types as
 data.</div>
<br>
<p>So why bother? Well, because <code>[T]</code> can only be used behind a pointer, if we
didn’t have language support for unsized types, it would be impossible to write
this:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust,ignore"><div data-l="impl Foo for str {"></div></div>
<br>
<p>or</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust,ignore"><div data-l="impl&lt;T&gt; Foo for [T] {"></div></div>
<br>
<p>Instead, you would have to write:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust,ignore"><div data-l="impl Foo for &amp;str {"></div></div>
<br>
<p>Meaning, this implementation would only work for <a class="notranslate" href="#3ref">references</a>, and not
other types of pointers. With the <code>impl for str</code>, all pointers, including (at
some point, there are some bugs to fix first) user-defined custom smart
pointers, can use this <code>impl</code>.</p>
<br>
<a class="notranslate" href="#1references-and-borrowing.html">ref</a>
<br>
<h1>?Sized</h1>
<br>
<p>If you want to write a function that accepts a dynamically sized type, you
can use the special bound syntax, <code>?Sized</code>:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="struct Foo&lt;T: ?Sized&gt; {"></div><div data-l="    f: T,"></div><div data-l="}"></div></div>
<br>
<p>This <code>?Sized</code>, read as “T may or may not be <code>Sized</code>”, which allows us to match
both sized and unsized types. All generic type parameters implicitly
have the <code>Sized</code> bound, so the <code>?Sized</code> can be used to opt-out of the implicit
bound.</p>
