<h1>Advanced Features</h1>
<br>
<p>By now, you’ve learned the most commonly used parts of the Rust programming
language. Before we do one more project in Chapter 20, we’ll look at a few
aspects of the language you might run into every once in a while. You can use
this chapter as a reference for when you encounter any unknowns when using
Rust. The features you’ll learn to use in this chapter are useful in very
specific situations. Although you might not reach for them often, we want to
make sure you have a grasp of all the features Rust has to offer.</p>
<br>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll cover:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="*">Unsafe Rust: how to opt out of some of Rust’s guarantees and take
responsibility for manually upholding those guarantees</div>
<div data-b="*">Advanced lifetimes: syntax for complex lifetime situations</div>
<div data-b="*">Advanced traits: associated types, default type parameters, fully qualified
syntax, supertraits, and the newtype pattern in relation to traits</div>
<div data-b="*">Advanced types: more about the newtype pattern, type aliases, the never type,
and dynamically sized types</div>
<div data-b="*">Advanced functions and closures: function pointers and returning closures</div>
<br>
<p>It’s a panoply of Rust features with something for everyone! Let’s dive in!</p>
