<h2>Reading a File</h2>
<br>
<p>Now we’ll add functionality to read the file that is specified in the
<code>filename</code> command line argument. First, we need a sample file to test it with:
the best kind of file to use to make sure <code>minigrep</code> is working is one with a
small amount of text over multiple lines with some repeated words. Listing 12-3
has an Emily Dickinson poem that will work well! Create a file called
<i>poem.txt</i> at the root level of your project, and enter the poem “I’m Nobody!
Who are you?”</p>
<br>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: poem.txt</span></p>
<br>
<div data-lang="text"><div data-l="I'm nobody! Who are you?"></div><div data-l="Are you nobody, too?"></div><div data-l="Then there's a pair of us - don't tell!"></div><div data-l="They'd banish us, you know."></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="How dreary to be somebody!"></div><div data-l="How public, like a frog"></div><div data-l="To tell your name the livelong day"></div><div data-l="To an admiring bog!"></div></div>
<br>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-3: A poem by Emily Dickinson makes a good test
case</span></p>
<br>
<p>With the text in place, edit <i>src/main.rs</i> and add code to open the file, as
shown in Listing 12-4.</p>
<br>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust,should_panic"><div data-l="use std::env;"></div><div data-l="use std::fs::File;"></div><div data-l="use std::io::prelude::*;"></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="fn main() {"></div><div data-l="#     let args: Vec&lt;String&gt; = env::args().collect();"></div><div data-l="#"></div><div data-l="#     let query = &amp;args[1];"></div><div data-l="#     let filename = &amp;args[2];"></div><div data-l="#"></div><div data-l="#     println!(&quot;Searching for {}&quot;, query);"></div><div data-l="#    // --snip--"></div><div data-l="    // ">--snip--</div><div data-l="    println!(&quot;In file {}&quot;, filename);"></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="    let mut f = File::open(filename).expect(&quot;file not found&quot;);"></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="    let mut contents = String::new();"></div><div data-l="    f.read_to_string(&amp;mut contents)"></div><div data-l="        .expect(&quot;something went wrong reading the file&quot;);"></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="    println!(&quot;With text:\n{}&quot;, contents);"></div><div data-l="}"></div></div>
<br>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 12-4: Reading the contents of the file specified
by the second argument</span></p>
<br>
<p>First, we add some more <code>use</code> statements to bring in relevant parts of the
standard library: we need <code>std::fs::File</code> to handle files, and
<code>std::io::prelude::*</code> contains various useful traits for doing I/O, including
file I/O. In the same way that Rust has a general prelude that brings certain
types and functions into scope automatically, the <code>std::io</code> module has its own
prelude of common types and functions you’ll need when working with I/O. Unlike
with the default prelude, we must explicitly add a <code>use</code> statement for the
prelude from <code>std::io</code>.</p>
<br>
<p>In <code>main</code>, we’ve added three statements: first, we get a mutable handle to the
file by calling the <code>File::open</code> function and passing it the value of the
<code>filename</code> variable. Second, we create a variable called <code>contents</code> and set it
to a mutable, empty <code>String</code>. This will hold the content of the file after we
read it in. Third, we call <code>read_to_string</code> on our file handle and pass a
mutable reference to <code>contents</code> as an argument.</p>
<br>
<p>After those lines, we’ve again added a temporary <code>println€</code> statement that
prints the value of <code>contents</code> after the file is read, so we can check that the
program is working so far.</p>
<br>
<p>Let’s run this code with any string as the first command line argument (because
we haven’t implemented the searching part yet) and the <i>poem.txt</i> file as the
second argument:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="text"><div data-l="$ cargo run the poem.txt"></div><div data-l="   Compiling minigrep v0.1.0 (file:///projects/minigrep)"></div><div data-l="    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs"></div><div data-l="     Running `target/debug/minigrep the poem.txt`"></div><div data-l="Searching for the"></div><div data-l="In file poem.txt"></div><div data-l="With text:"></div><div data-l="I'm nobody! Who are you?"></div><div data-l="Are you nobody, too?"></div><div data-l="Then there's a pair of us - don't tell!"></div><div data-l="They'd banish us, you know."></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="How dreary to be somebody!"></div><div data-l="How public, like a frog"></div><div data-l="To tell your name the livelong day"></div><div data-l="To an admiring bog!"></div></div>
<br>
<p>Great! The code read and then printed the contents of the file. But the code
has a few flaws. The <code>main</code> function has multiple responsibilities: generally,
functions are clearer and easier to maintain if each function is responsible
for only one idea. The other problem is that we’re not handling errors as well
as we could. The program is still small, so these flaws aren’t a big problem,
but as the program grows, it will be harder to fix them cleanly. It’s good
practice to begin refactoring early on when developing a program, because it’s
much easier to refactor smaller amounts of code. We’ll do that next.</p>
