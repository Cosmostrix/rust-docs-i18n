<h2>Defining and Instantiating Structs</h2>
<br>
<p>Structs are similar to tuples, which were discussed in Chapter 3. Like tuples,
the pieces of a struct can be different types. Unlike with tuples, you’ll name
each piece of data so it’s clear what the values mean. As a result of these
names, structs are more flexible than tuples: you don’t have to rely on the
order of the data to specify or access the values of an instance.</p>
<br>
<p>To define a struct, we enter the keyword <code>struct</code> and name the entire struct. A
struct’s name should describe the significance of the pieces of data being
grouped together. Then, inside curly brackets, we define the names and types of
the pieces of data, which we call <i>fields</i>. For example, Listing 5-1 shows a
struct that stores information about a user account.</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="struct User {"></div><div data-l="    username: String,"></div><div data-l="    email: String,"></div><div data-l="    sign_in_count: u64,"></div><div data-l="    active: bool,"></div><div data-l="}"></div></div>
<br>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-1: A <code>User</code> struct definition</span></p>
<br>
<p>To use a struct after we’ve defined it, we create an <i>instance</i> of that struct
by specifying concrete values for each of the fields. We create an instance by
stating the name of the struct and then add curly brackets containing <code>key:
value</code> pairs, where the keys are the names of the fields and the values are the
data we want to store in those fields. We don’t have to specify the fields in
the same order in which we declared them in the struct. In other words, the
struct definition is like a general template for the type, and instances fill
in that template with particular data to create values of the type. For
example, we can declare a particular user as shown in Listing 5-2.</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="# struct User {"></div><div data-l="#     username: String,"></div><div data-l="#     email: String,"></div><div data-l="#     sign_in_count: u64,"></div><div data-l="#     active: bool,"></div><div data-l="# }"></div><div data-l="#"></div><div data-l="let user1 = User {"></div><div data-l="    email: String::from(&quot;someone@example.com&quot;),"></div><div data-l="    username: String::from(&quot;someusername123&quot;),"></div><div data-l="    active: true,"></div><div data-l="    sign_in_count: 1,"></div><div data-l="};"></div></div>
<br>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-2: Creating an instance of the <code>User</code>
struct</span></p>
<br>
<p>To get a specific value from a struct, we can use dot notation. If we wanted
just this user’s email address, we could use <code>user1.email</code> wherever we wanted
to use this value. If the instance is mutable, we can change a value by using
the dot notation and assigning into a particular field. Listing 5-3 shows how
to change the value in the <code>email</code> field of a mutable <code>User</code> instance.</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="# struct User {"></div><div data-l="#     username: String,"></div><div data-l="#     email: String,"></div><div data-l="#     sign_in_count: u64,"></div><div data-l="#     active: bool,"></div><div data-l="# }"></div><div data-l="#"></div><div data-l="let mut user1 = User {"></div><div data-l="    email: String::from(&quot;someone@example.com&quot;),"></div><div data-l="    username: String::from(&quot;someusername123&quot;),"></div><div data-l="    active: true,"></div><div data-l="    sign_in_count: 1,"></div><div data-l="};"></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="user1.email = String::from(&quot;anotheremail@example.com&quot;);"></div></div>
<br>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-3: Changing the value in the <code>email</code> field of a
<code>User</code> instance</span></p>
<br>
<p>Note that the entire instance must be mutable; Rust doesn’t allow us to mark
only certain fields as mutable. As with any expression, we can construct a new
instance of the struct as the last expression in the function body to
implicitly return that new instance.</p>
<br>
<p>Listing 5-4 shows a <code>build_user</code> function that returns a <code>User</code> instance with
the given email and username. The <code>active</code> field gets the value of <code>true</code>, and
the <code>sign_in_count</code> gets a value of <code>1</code>.</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="# struct User {"></div><div data-l="#     username: String,"></div><div data-l="#     email: String,"></div><div data-l="#     sign_in_count: u64,"></div><div data-l="#     active: bool,"></div><div data-l="# }"></div><div data-l="#"></div><div data-l="fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -&gt; User {"></div><div data-l="    User {"></div><div data-l="        email: email,"></div><div data-l="        username: username,"></div><div data-l="        active: true,"></div><div data-l="        sign_in_count: 1,"></div><div data-l="    }"></div><div data-l="}"></div></div>
<br>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-4: A <code>build_user</code> function that takes an email
and username and returns a <code>User</code> instance</span></p>
<br>
<p>It makes sense to name the function parameters with the same name as the struct
fields, but having to repeat the <code>email</code> and <code>username</code> field names and
variables is a bit tedious. If the struct had more fields, repeating each name
would get even more annoying. Luckily, there’s a convenient shorthand!</p>
<br>
<h3>Using the Field Init Shorthand when Variables and Fields Have the Same Name</h3>
<br>
<p>Because the parameter names and the struct field names are exactly the same in
Listing 5-4, we can use the <i>field init shorthand</i> syntax to rewrite
<code>build_user</code> so that it behaves exactly the same but doesn’t have the
repetition of <code>email</code> and <code>username</code>, as shown in Listing 5-5.</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="# struct User {"></div><div data-l="#     username: String,"></div><div data-l="#     email: String,"></div><div data-l="#     sign_in_count: u64,"></div><div data-l="#     active: bool,"></div><div data-l="# }"></div><div data-l="#"></div><div data-l="fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -&gt; User {"></div><div data-l="    User {"></div><div data-l="        email,"></div><div data-l="        username,"></div><div data-l="        active: true,"></div><div data-l="        sign_in_count: 1,"></div><div data-l="    }"></div><div data-l="}"></div></div>
<br>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-5: A <code>build_user</code> function that uses field init
shorthand because the <code>email</code> and <code>username</code> parameters have the same name as
struct fields</span></p>
<br>
<p>Here, we’re creating a new instance of the <code>User</code> struct, which has a field
named <code>email</code>. We want to set the <code>email</code> field’s value to the value in the
<code>email</code> parameter of the <code>build_user</code> function. Because the <code>email</code> field and
the <code>email</code> parameter have the same name, we only need to write <code>email</code> rather
than <code>email: email</code>.</p>
<br>
<h3>Creating Instances From Other Instances With Struct Update Syntax</h3>
<br>
<p>It’s often useful to create a new instance of a struct that uses most of an old
instance’s values but changes some. You’ll do this using <i>struct update syntax</i>.</p>
<br>
<p>First, Listing 5-6 shows how we create a new <code>User</code> instance in <code>user2</code> without
the update syntax. We set new values for <code>email</code> and <code>username</code> but otherwise
use the same values from <code>user1</code> that we created in Listing 5-2.</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="# struct User {"></div><div data-l="#     username: String,"></div><div data-l="#     email: String,"></div><div data-l="#     sign_in_count: u64,"></div><div data-l="#     active: bool,"></div><div data-l="# }"></div><div data-l="#"></div><div data-l="# let user1 = User {"></div><div data-l="#     email: String::from(&quot;someone@example.com&quot;),"></div><div data-l="#     username: String::from(&quot;someusername123&quot;),"></div><div data-l="#     active: true,"></div><div data-l="#     sign_in_count: 1,"></div><div data-l="# };"></div><div data-l="#"></div><div data-l="let user2 = User {"></div><div data-l="    email: String::from(&quot;another@example.com&quot;),"></div><div data-l="    username: String::from(&quot;anotherusername567&quot;),"></div><div data-l="    active: user1.active,"></div><div data-l="    sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,"></div><div data-l="};"></div></div>
<br>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-6: Creating a new <code>User</code> instance using some of
the values from <code>user1</code></span></p>
<br>
<p>Using struct update syntax, we can achieve the same effect with less code, as
shown in Listing 5-7. The syntax <code>..</code> specifies that the remaining fields not
explicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given instance.</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="# struct User {"></div><div data-l="#     username: String,"></div><div data-l="#     email: String,"></div><div data-l="#     sign_in_count: u64,"></div><div data-l="#     active: bool,"></div><div data-l="# }"></div><div data-l="#"></div><div data-l="# let user1 = User {"></div><div data-l="#     email: String::from(&quot;someone@example.com&quot;),"></div><div data-l="#     username: String::from(&quot;someusername123&quot;),"></div><div data-l="#     active: true,"></div><div data-l="#     sign_in_count: 1,"></div><div data-l="# };"></div><div data-l="#"></div><div data-l="let user2 = User {"></div><div data-l="    email: String::from(&quot;another@example.com&quot;),"></div><div data-l="    username: String::from(&quot;anotherusername567&quot;),"></div><div data-l="    ..user1"></div><div data-l="};"></div></div>
<br>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 5-7: Using struct update syntax to set new
<code>email</code> and <code>username</code> values for a <code>User</code> instance but use the rest of the
values from the fields of the instance in the <code>user1</code> variable</span></p>
<br>
<p>The code in Listing 5-7 also creates an instance in <code>user2</code> that has a
different value for <code>email</code> and <code>username</code> but has the same values for the
<code>active</code> and <code>sign_in_count</code> fields from <code>user1</code>.</p>
<br>
<h3>Using Tuple Structs without Named Fields to Create Different Types</h3>
<br>
<p>You can also define structs that look similar to tuples, called <i>tuple
structs</i>. Tuple structs have the added meaning the struct name provides but
don’t have names associated with their fields; rather, they just have the types
of the fields. Tuple structs are useful when you want to give the whole tuple a
name and make the tuple be a different type than other tuples, and naming each
field as in a regular struct would be verbose or redundant.</p>
<br>
<p>To define a tuple struct, start with the <code>struct</code> keyword and the struct name
followed by the types in the tuple. For example, here are definitions and
usages of two tuple structs named <code>Color</code> and <code>Point</code>:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="struct Color(i32, i32, i32);"></div><div data-l="struct Point(i32, i32, i32);"></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="let black = Color(0, 0, 0);"></div><div data-l="let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);"></div></div>
<br>
<p>Note that the <code>black</code> and <code>origin</code> values are different types, because they’re
instances of different tuple structs. Each struct you define is its own type,
even though the fields within the struct have the same types. For example, a
function that takes a parameter of type <code>Color</code> cannot take a <code>Point</code> as an
argument, even though both types are made up of three <code>i32</code> values. Otherwise,
tuple struct instances behave like tuples: you can destructure them into their
individual pieces, you can use a <code>.</code> followed by the index to access an
individual value, and so on.</p>
<br>
<h3>Unit-Like Structs Without Any Fields</h3>
<br>
<p>You can also define structs that don’t have any fields! These are called
<i>unit-like structs</i> because they behave similarly to <code>()</code>, the unit type.
Unit-like structs can be useful in situations in which you need to implement a
trait on some type but don’t have any data that you want to store in the type
itself. We’ll discuss traits in Chapter 10.</p>
<br>
<blockquote><h3>Ownership of Struct Data</h3>
<br>
<p>In the <code>User</code> struct definition in Listing 5-1, we used the owned <code>String</code>
type rather than the <code>&amp;str</code> string slice type. This is a deliberate choice
because we want instances of this struct to own all of its data and for that
data to be valid for as long as the entire struct is valid.</p>
<br>
<p>It’s possible for structs to store references to data owned by something else,
but to do so requires the use of <i>lifetimes</i>, a Rust feature that we’ll
discuss in Chapter 10. Lifetimes ensure that the data referenced by a struct
is valid for as long as the struct is. Let’s say you try to store a reference
in a struct without specifying lifetimes, like this, which won’t work:</p>
<br>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust,ignore"><div data-l="struct User {"></div><div data-l="    username: &amp;str,"></div><div data-l="    email: &amp;str,"></div><div data-l="    sign_in_count: u64,"></div><div data-l="    active: bool,"></div><div data-l="}"></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="fn main() {"></div><div data-l="    let user1 = User {"></div><div data-l="        email: &quot;someone@example.com&quot;,"></div><div data-l="        username: &quot;someusername123&quot;,"></div><div data-l="        active: true,"></div><div data-l="        sign_in_count: 1,"></div><div data-l="    };"></div><div data-l="}"></div></div>
<br>
<p>The compiler will complain that it needs lifetime specifiers:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="text"><div data-l="error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier"></div><div data-l=" --&gt;"></div><div data-l="  |"></div><div data-l="2 |     username: &amp;str,"></div><div data-l="  |               ^ expected lifetime parameter"></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier"></div><div data-l=" --&gt;"></div><div data-l="  |"></div><div data-l="3 |     email: &amp;str,"></div><div data-l="  |            ^ expected lifetime parameter"></div></div>
<br>
<p>In Chapter 10, we’ll discuss how to fix these errors so you can store
references in structs, but for now, we’ll fix errors like these using owned
types like <code>String</code> instead of references like <code>&amp;str</code>.</p></blockquote>
