<h1>More About Cargo and Crates.io</h1>
<br>
<p>So far we’ve used only the most basic features of Cargo to build, run, and test
our code, but it can do a lot more. In this chapter, we’ll discuss some of its
other, more advanced features to show you how to do the following:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="*">Customize your build through release profiles</div>
<div data-b="*">Publish libraries on <a class="notranslate" href="#2https://crates.io">crates.io</a><!-- ignore --></div>
<div data-b="*">Organize large projects with workspaces</div>
<div data-b="*">Install binaries from <a class="notranslate" href="#2https://crates.io">crates.io</a><!-- ignore --></div>
<div data-b="*">Extend Cargo using custom commands</div>
<br>
<p>Cargo can do even more than what we cover in this chapter, so for a full
explanation of all its features, see <a class="notranslate" href="#2https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/">its
documentation</a>.</p>
