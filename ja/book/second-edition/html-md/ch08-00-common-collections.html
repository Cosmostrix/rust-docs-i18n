<h1>Common Collections</h1>
<br>
<p>Rust’s standard library includes a number of very useful data structures called
<i>collections</i>. Most other data types represent one specific value, but
collections can contain multiple values. Unlike the built-in array and tuple
types, the data these collections point to is stored on the heap, which means
the amount of data does not need to be known at compile time and can grow or
shrink as the program runs. Each kind of collection has different capabilities
and costs, and choosing an appropriate one for your current situation is a
skill you’ll develop over time. In this chapter, we’ll discuss three
collections that are used very often in Rust programs:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="*">A <i>vector</i> allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other.</div>
<div data-b="*">A <i>string</i> is a collection of characters. We’ve mentioned the <code>String</code> type
previously, but in this chapter we’ll talk about it in depth.</div>
<div data-b="*">A <i>hash map</i> allows you to associate a value with a particular key. It’s a
particular implementation of the more general data structure called a <i>map</i>.</div>
<br>

<p>We’ll discuss how to create and update vectors, strings, and hash maps, as well
as what makes each special.</p>
