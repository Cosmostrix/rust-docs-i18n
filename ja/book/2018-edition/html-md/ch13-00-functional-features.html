<h1>Functional Language Features: Iterators and Closures</h1>
<br>
<p>Rust’s design has taken inspiration from many existing languages and
techniques, and one significant influence is <i>functional programming</i>.
Programming in a functional style often includes using functions as values by
passing them in arguments, returning them from other functions, assigning them
to variables for later execution, and so forth.</p>
<br>
<p>In this chapter, we won’t debate the issue of what functional programming is or
isn’t but will instead discuss some features of Rust that are similar to
features in many languages often referred to as functional.</p>
<br>
<p>More specifically, we’ll cover:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="*"><i>Closures</i>, a function-like construct you can store in a variable</div>
<div data-b="*"><i>Iterators</i>, a way of processing a series of elements</div>
<div data-b="*">How to use these two features to improve the I/O project in Chapter 12</div>
<div data-b="*">The performance of these two features (Spoiler alert: they’re faster than you
might think!)</div>
<br>
<p>Other Rust features, such as pattern matching and enums, which we’ve covered in
other chapters, are influenced by the functional style as well. Mastering
closures and iterators is an important part of writing idiomatic, fast Rust
code, so we’ll devote this entire chapter to them.</p>
