<h2>Advanced Functions and Closures</h2>
<br>
<p>Finally, we’ll explore some advanced features related to functions and
closures, which include function pointers and returning closures.</p>
<br>
<h3>Function Pointers</h3>
<br>
<p>We’ve talked about how to pass closures to functions; you can also pass regular
functions to functions! This technique is useful when you want to pass a
function you’ve already defined rather than defining a new closure. Doing this
with function pointers will allow you to use functions as arguments to other
functions. Functions coerce to the type <code>fn</code> (with a lowercase f), not to be
confused with the <code>Fn</code> closure trait. The <code>fn</code> type is called a <i>function
pointer</i>. The syntax for specifying that a parameter is a function pointer is
similar to that of closures, as shown in Listing 19-35.</p>
<br>
<p><span class="filename">Filename: src/main.rs</span></p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="fn add_one(x: i32) -&gt; i32 {"></div><div data-l="    x + 1"></div><div data-l="}"></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="fn do_twice(f: fn(i32) -&gt; i32, arg: i32) -&gt; i32 {"></div><div data-l="    f(arg) + f(arg)"></div><div data-l="}"></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="fn main() {"></div><div data-l="    let answer = do_twice(add_one, 5);"></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="    println!(&quot;The answer is: {}&quot;, answer);"></div><div data-l="}"></div></div>
<br>
<p><span class="caption">Listing 19-35: Using the <code>fn</code> type to accept a function
pointer as an argument</span></p>
<br>
<p>This code prints <code>The answer is: 12</code>. We specify that the parameter <code>f</code> in
<code>do_twice</code> is an <code>fn</code> that takes one parameter of type <code>i32</code> and returns an
<code>i32</code>. We can then call <code>f</code> in the body of <code>do_twice</code>. In <code>main</code>, we can pass
the function name <code>add_one</code> as the first argument to <code>do_twice</code>.</p>
<br>
<p>Unlike closures, <code>fn</code> is a type rather than a trait, so we specify <code>fn</code> as the
parameter type directly rather than declaring a generic type parameter with one
of the <code>Fn</code> traits as a trait bound.</p>
<br>
<p>Function pointers implement all three of the closure traits (<code>Fn</code>, <code>FnMut</code>, and
<code>FnOnce</code>), so you can always pass a function pointer as an argument for a
function that expects a closure. It’s best to write functions using a generic
type and one of the closure traits so your functions can accept either
functions or closures.</p>
<br>
<p>An example of where you would want to only accept <code>fn</code> and not closures is when
interfacing with external code that doesn’t have closures: C functions can
accept functions as arguments, but C doesn’t have closures.</p>
<br>
<p>As an example of where you could use either a closure defined inline or a named
function, let’s look at a use of <code>map</code>. To use the <code>map</code> function to turn a
vector of numbers into a vector of strings, we could use a closure, like this:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="let list_of_numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];"></div><div data-l="let list_of_strings: Vec&lt;String&gt; = list_of_numbers"></div><div data-l="    .iter()"></div><div data-l="    .map(|i| i.to_string())"></div><div data-l="    .collect();"></div></div>
<br>
<p>Or we could name a function as the argument to <code>map</code> instead of the closure,
like this:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="let list_of_numbers = vec![1, 2, 3];"></div><div data-l="let list_of_strings: Vec&lt;String&gt; = list_of_numbers"></div><div data-l="    .iter()"></div><div data-l="    .map(ToString::to_string)"></div><div data-l="    .collect();"></div></div>
<br>
<p>Note that we must use the fully qualified syntax that we talked about earlier
in the “Advanced Traits” section because there are multiple functions available
named <code>to_string</code>. Here, we’re using the <code>to_string</code> function defined in the
<code>ToString</code> trait, which the standard library has implemented for any type that
implements <code>Display</code>.</p>
<br>
<p>Some people prefer this style, and some people prefer to use closures. They end
up compiling to the same code, so use whichever style is clearer to you.</p>
<br>
<h3>Returning Closures</h3>
<br>
<p>Closures are represented by traits, which means you can’t return closures
directly. In most cases where you might want to return a trait, you can instead
use the concrete type that implements the trait as the return value of the
function. But you can’t do that with closures because they don’t have a
concrete type that is returnable; you’re not allowed to use the function
pointer <code>fn</code> as a return type, for example.</p>
<br>
<p>The following code tries to return a closure directly, but it won’t compile:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust,ignore"><div data-l="fn returns_closure() -&gt; Fn(i32) -&gt; i32 {"></div><div data-l="    |x| x + 1"></div><div data-l="}"></div></div>
<br>
<p>The compiler error is as follows:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="text"><div data-l="error[E0277]: the trait bound `std::ops::Fn(i32) -&gt; i32 + 'static:"></div><div data-l="std::marker::Sized` is not satisfied"></div><div data-l=" --&gt;"></div><div data-l="  |"></div><div data-l="1 | fn returns_closure() -&gt; Fn(i32) -&gt; i32 {"></div><div data-l="  |                         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ `std::ops::Fn(i32) -&gt; i32 + 'static`"></div><div data-l="  does not have a constant size known at compile-time"></div><div data-l="  |"></div><div data-l="  = help: the trait `std::marker::Sized` is not implemented for"></div><div data-l="  `std::ops::Fn(i32) -&gt; i32 + 'static`"></div><div data-l="  = note: the return type of a function must have a statically known size"></div></div>
<br>
<p>The error references the <code>Sized</code> trait again! Rust doesn’t know how much space
it will need to store the closure. We saw a solution to this problem earlier.
We can use a trait object:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="fn returns_closure() -&gt; Box&lt;dyn Fn(i32) -&gt; i32&gt; {"></div><div data-l="    Box::new(|x| x + 1)"></div><div data-l="}"></div></div>
<br>
<p>This code will compile just fine. For more about trait objects, refer to the
“Using Trait Objects That Allow for Values of Different Types” section in
Chapter 17.</p>
<br>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<br>
<p>Whew! Now you have some features of Rust in your toolbox that you won’t use
often, but you’ll know they’re available in very particular circumstances.
We’ve introduced several complex topics so that when you encounter them in
error message suggestions or in other peoples’ code, you’ll be able to
recognize these concepts and syntax. Use this chapter as a reference to guide
you to solutions.</p>
<br>
<p>Next, we’ll put everything we’ve discussed throughout the book into practice
and do one more project!</p>
