<h1>G - Other useful tools</h1>
<br>
<p>In this appendix, we'll talk about some additional tools that are provided by
the Rust project, and are useful when developing Rust code.</p>
<br>
<h2>Automatic formatting with <code>rustfmt</code></h2>
<br>
<p><code>rustfmt</code> is a tool that can re-format your code according to community
norms. Many projects use <code>rustfmt</code> to prevent arguments about which style to
use when writing Rust: just do what the tool does!</p>
<br>
<p><code>rustfmt</code> is not at 1.0 yet, but a preview is available for you to use in
the meantime. Please give it a try and let us know how it goes!</p>
<br>
<p>To install <code>rustfmt</code>:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="shell"><div data-l="$ rustup component add rustfmt-preview"></div></div>
<br>
<p>This will give you both <code>rustfmt</code> and <code>cargo-fmt</code>, similar to how Rust gives
you both <code>rustc</code> and <code>cargo</code>. To take any Cargo project and format it:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="shell"><div data-l="$ cargo fmt"></div></div>
<br>
<h2>IDE integration with the Rust Language Server</h2>
<br>
<p>To help IDE integration, the Rust project distributes <code>rls</code>, the Rust
Language Server, as in <http://langserver.org/>. This can be used by
different clients, such as <a href="#2https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rust-lang.rust">the Rust plugin for Visual Studio:
Code</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>The <code>rls</code> is not at 1.0 yet, but a preview is available for you to use in the
meantime. Please give it a try and let us know how it goes!</p>
<br>
<p>To install the <code>rls</code>:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="shell"><div data-l="$ rustup component add rls-preview"></div></div>
<br>
<p>Then, install the language server support in your particular IDE, and it
should all work.</p>
