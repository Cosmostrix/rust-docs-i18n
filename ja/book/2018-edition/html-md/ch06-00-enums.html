<h1>Enums and Pattern Matching</h1>
<br>
<p>In this chapter we’ll look at <i>enumerations</i>, also referred to as <i>enums</i>.
Enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible values. First,
we’ll define and use an enum to show how an enum can encode meaning along with
data. Next, we’ll explore a particularly useful enum, called <code>Option</code>, which
expresses that a value can be either something or nothing. Then we’ll look at
how pattern matching in the <code>match</code> expression makes it easy to run different
code for different values of an enum. Finally, we’ll cover how the <code>if let</code>
construct is another convenient and concise idiom available to you to handle
enums in your code.</p>

<p>Enums are a feature in many languages, but their capabilities differ in each
language. Rust’s enums are most similar to <i>algebraic data types</i> in functional
languages, such as F#, OCaml, and Haskell.</p>
