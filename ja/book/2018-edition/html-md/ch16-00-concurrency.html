<h1>Fearless Concurrency</h1>
<br>
<p>Handling concurrent programming safely and efficiently is another of Rust’s
major goals. <i>Concurrent programming</i>, where different parts of a program
execute independently, and <i>parallel programming</i>, where different parts of a
program execute at the same time, are becoming increasingly important as more
computers take advantage of their multiple processors. Historically,
programming in these contexts has been difficult and error prone: Rust hopes to
change that.</p>
<br>
<p>Initially, the Rust team thought that ensuring memory safety and preventing
concurrency problems were two separate challenges to be solved with different
methods. Over time, the team discovered that the ownership and type systems are
a powerful set of tools to help manage memory safety <i>and</i> concurrency
problems! By leveraging ownership and type checking, many concurrency errors
are compile-time errors in Rust rather than runtime errors. Therefore, rather
than making you spend lots of time trying to reproduce the exact circumstances
under which a runtime concurrency bug occurs, incorrect code will refuse to
compile and present an error explaining the problem. As a result, you can fix
your code while you’re working on it rather than potentially after it has been
shipped to production. We’ve nicknamed this aspect of Rust <i>fearless</i>
<i>concurrency</i>. Fearless concurrency allows you to write code that is free of
subtle bugs and is easy to refactor without introducing new bugs.</p>
<br>
<blockquote><p>Note: For simplicity’s sake, we’ll refer to many of the problems as
<i>concurrent</i> rather than being more precise by saying <i>concurrent and/or
parallel</i>. If this book were about concurrency and/or parallelism, we’d be
more specific. For this chapter, please mentally substitute <i>concurrent
and/or parallel</i> whenever we use <i>concurrent</i>.</p></blockquote>
<br>
<p>Many languages are dogmatic about the solutions they offer for handling
concurrent problems. For example, Erlang has elegant functionality for
message-passing concurrency but has only obscure ways to share state between
threads. Supporting only a subset of possible solutions is a reasonable
strategy for higher-level languages, because a higher-level language promises
benefits from giving up some control to gain abstractions. However, lower-level
languages are expected to provide the solution with the best performance in any
given situation and have fewer abstractions over the hardware. Therefore, Rust
offers a variety of tools for modeling problems in whatever way is appropriate
for your situation and requirements.</p>

<div data-b="*"><i>Message-passing</i> concurrency, where channels send messages between threads</div>
<div data-b="*"><i>Shared-state</i> concurrency, where multiple threads have access to some piece
of data</div>
<div data-b="*">The <code>Sync</code> and <code>Send</code> traits, which extend Rust’s concurrency guarantees to
user-defined types as well as types provided by the standard library</div>
