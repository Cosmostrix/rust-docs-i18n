<h1>Modules</h1>
<br>
<p>Rust provides a powerful module system that can be used to hierarchically split
code in logical units (modules), and manage visibility (public/private) between
them.</p>
<br>
<p>A module is a collection of items: functions, structs, traits, <code>impl</code> blocks,
and even other modules.</p>
