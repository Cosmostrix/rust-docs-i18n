<h1>Crates</h1>
<br>
<p>A crate is a compilation unit in Rust. Whenever <code>rustc some_file.rs</code> is called,
<code>some_file.rs</code> is treated as the <i>crate file</i>. If <code>some_file.rs</code> has <code>mod</code>
declarations in it, then the contents of the module files would be inserted in
places where <code>mod</code> declarations in the crate file are found, <i>before</i> running
the compiler over it. In other words, modules do <i>not</i> get compiled
individually, only crates get compiled.</p>
<br>
<p>A crate can be compiled into a binary or into a library. By default, <code>rustc</code>
will produce a binary from a crate. This behavior can be overridden by passing
the <code>--crate-type</code> flag to <code>rustc</code>.</p>
