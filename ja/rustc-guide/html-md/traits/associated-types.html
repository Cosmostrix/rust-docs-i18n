<h1>Equality and associated types</h1>
<br>
<p>This section covers how the trait system handles equality between
associated types. The full system consists of several moving parts,
which we will introduce one by one:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="-">Projection and the <code>Normalize</code> predicate</div>
<div data-b="-">Skolemization</div>
<div data-b="-">The <code>ProjectionEq</code> predicate</div>
<div data-b="-">Integration with unification</div>
<br>
<h2>Associated type projection and normalization</h2>
<br>
<p>When a trait defines an associated type (e.g.,
<a href="#3intoiter-item">the <code>Item</code> type in the <code>IntoIterator</code> trait</a>), that
type can be referenced by the user using an <b>associated type
projection</b> like <code>&lt;Option&lt;u32&gt; as IntoIterator&gt;::Item</code>. (Often,
though, people will use the shorthand syntax <code>T::Item</code> – presently,
that syntax is expanded during
<a href="#2./type-checking.html">&quot;type collection&quot;</a> into the explicit form,
though that is something we may want to change in the future.)</p>
<br>
<a class="notranslate" href="#1https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/core/iter/trait.IntoIterator.html#associatedtype.Item">intoiter-item</a>
<br>
<p><a name="normalize"></a></p>
<br>
<p>In some cases, associated type projections can be <b>normalized</b> –
that is, simplified – based on the types given in an impl. So, to
continue with our example, the impl of <code>IntoIterator</code> for <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>
declares (among other things) that <code>Item = T</code>:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust,ignore"><div data-l="impl&lt;T&gt; IntoIterator for Option&lt;T&gt; {"></div><div data-l="  type Item = T;"></div><div data-l="  ..."></div><div data-l="}"></div></div>
<br>
<p>This means we can normalize the projection <code>&lt;Option&lt;u32&gt; as
IntoIterator&gt;::Item</code> to just <code>u32</code>.</p>
<br>
<p>In this case, the projection was a &quot;monomorphic&quot; one – that is, it
did not have any type parameters.  Monomorphic projections are special
because they can <b>always</b> be fully normalized – but often we can
normalize other associated type projections as well. For example,
<code>&lt;Option&lt;?T&gt; as IntoIterator&gt;::Item</code> (where <code>?T</code> is an inference
variable) can be normalized to just <code>?T</code>.</p>
<br>
<p>In our logic, normalization is defined by a predicate
<code>Normalize</code>. The <code>Normalize</code> clauses arise only from
impls. For example, the <code>impl</code> of <code>IntoIterator</code> for <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> that
we saw above would be lowered to a program clause like so:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="text"><div data-l="forall&lt;T&gt; {"></div><div data-l="    Normalize(&lt;Option&lt;T&gt; as IntoIterator&gt;::Item -&gt; T) :-"></div><div data-l="        Implemented(Option&lt;T&gt;: IntoIterator)"></div><div data-l="}"></div></div>
<br>
<p>where in this case, the one <code>Implemented</code> condition is always true.</p>
<br>
<p>(An aside: since we do not permit quantification over traits, this is
really more like a family of program clauses, one for each associated
type.)</p>
<br>
<p>We could apply that rule to normalize either of the examples that
we've seen so far.</p>
<br>
<h2>Skolemized associated types</h2>
<br>
<p>Sometimes however we want to work with associated types that cannot be
normalized. For example, consider this function:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust,ignore"><div data-l="fn foo&lt;T: IntoIterator&gt;(...) { ... }"></div></div>
<br>
<p>In this context, how would we normalize the type <code>T::Item</code>? Without
knowing what <code>T</code> is, we can't really do so. To represent this case, we
introduce a type called a <b>skolemized associated type
projection</b>. This is written like so <code>(IntoIterator::Item)&lt;T&gt;</code>. You
may note that it looks a lot like a regular type (e.g., <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code>),
except that the &quot;name&quot; of the type is <code>(IntoIterator::Item)</code>. This is
not an accident: skolemized associated type projections work just like
ordinary types like <code>Vec&lt;T&gt;</code> when it comes to unification. That is,
they are only considered equal if (a) they are both references to the
same associated type, like <code>IntoIterator::Item</code> and (b) their type
arguments are equal.</p>
<br>
<p>Skolemized associated types are never written directly by the user.
They are used internally by the trait system only, as we will see
shortly.</p>
<br>
<h2>Projection equality</h2>
<br>
<p>So far we have seen two ways to answer the question of &quot;When can we
consider an associated type projection equal to another type?&quot;:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="-">the <code>Normalize</code> predicate could be used to transform associated type
projections when we knew which impl was applicable;</div>
<div data-b="-"><b>skolemized</b> associated types can be used when we don't.</div>
<br>
<p>We now introduce the <code>ProjectionEq</code> predicate to bring those two cases
together. The <code>ProjectionEq</code> predicate looks like so:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="text"><div data-l="ProjectionEq(&lt;T as IntoIterator&gt;::Item = U)"></div></div>
<br>
<p>and we will see that it can be proven <i>either</i> via normalization or
skolemization. As part of lowering an associated type declaration from
some trait, we create two program clauses for <code>ProjectionEq</code>:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="text"><div data-l="forall&lt;T, U&gt; {"></div><div data-l="    ProjectionEq(&lt;T as IntoIterator&gt;::Item = U) :-"></div><div data-l="        Normalize(&lt;T as IntoIterator&gt;::Item -&gt; U)"></div><div data-l="}"></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="forall&lt;T&gt; {"></div><div data-l="    ProjectionEq(&lt;T as IntoIterator&gt;::Item = (IntoIterator::Item)&lt;T&gt;)"></div><div data-l="}"></div></div>
<br>
<p>These are the only two <code>ProjectionEq</code> program clauses we ever make for
any given associated item.</p>
<br>
<h2>Integration with unification</h2>
<br>
<p>Now we are ready to discuss how associated type equality integrates
with unification. As described in the
<a href="#2./type-inference.html">type inference</a> section, unification is
basically a procedure with a signature like this:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="text"><div data-l="Unify(A, B) = Result&lt;(Subgoals, RegionConstraints), NoSolution&gt;"></div></div>
<br>
<p>In other words, we try to unify two things A and B. That procedure
might just fail, in which case we get back <code>Err(NoSolution)</code>. This
would happen, for example, if we tried to unify <code>u32</code> and <code>i32</code>.</p>
<br>
<p>The key point is that, on success, unification can also give back to
us a set of subgoals that still remain to be proven (it can also give
back region constraints, but those are not relevant here).</p>
<br>
<p>Whenever unification encounters an (unskolemized!) associated type
projection P being equated with some other type T, it always succeeds,
but it produces a subgoal <code>ProjectionEq(P = T)</code> that is propagated
back up. Thus it falls to the ordinary workings of the trait system
to process that constraint.</p>
<br>
<p>(If we unify two projections P1 and P2, then unification produces a
variable X and asks us to prove that <code>ProjectionEq(P1 = X)</code> and
<code>ProjectionEq(P2 = X)</code>. That used to be needed in an older system to
prevent cycles; I rather doubt it still is. -nmatsakis)</p>
