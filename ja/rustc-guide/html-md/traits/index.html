<h1>Trait solving (new-style)</h1>
<br>
<p>ðŸš§ This chapter describes &quot;new-style&quot; trait solving. This is still in the
<a href="#3wg">process of being implemented</a>; this chapter serves as a kind of
in-progress design document. If you would prefer to read about how the
current trait solver works, check out
<a href="#2./traits/resolution.html">this other chapter</a>. (By the way, if you
would like to help in hacking on the new solver, you will find
instructions for getting involved in the
<a href="#3wg">Traits Working Group tracking issue</a>.) ðŸš§</p>

<p>Trait solving is based around a few key ideas:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="-"><a href="#2./traits/lowering-to-logic.html">Lowering to logic</a>, which expresses
Rust traits in terms of standard logical terms.</div>
<div data-b="  -">The <a href="#2./traits/goals-and-clauses.html">goals and clauses</a> chapter
describes the precise form of rules we use, and
<a href="#2./traits/lowering-rules.html">lowering rules</a> gives the complete set of
lowering rules in a more reference-like form.</div>
<div data-b="-"><a href="#2./traits/canonical-queries.html">Canonical queries</a>, which allow us
to solve trait problems (like &quot;is <code>Foo</code> implemented for the type
<code>Bar</code>?&quot;) once, and then apply that same result independently in many
different inference contexts.</div>
<div data-b="-"><a href="#2./traits/associated-types.html">Lazy normalization</a>, which is the
technique we use to accommodate associated types when figuring out
whether types are equal.</div>
<p>- <a href="#2./traits/regions.html">Region constraints</a>, which are accumulated
  during trait solving but mostly ignored. This means that trait
  solving effectively ignores the precise regions involved, always â€“
  but we still remember the constraints on them so that those
  constraints can be checked by thet type checker.
