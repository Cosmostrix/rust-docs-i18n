<h1>Type checking</h1>
<br>
<p>The <a class="notranslate" href="#3typeck"><code>rustc_typeck</code></a> crate contains the source for &quot;type collection&quot;
and &quot;type checking&quot;, as well as a few other bits of related functionality. (It
draws heavily on the <a class="notranslate" href="#4type inference">type inference</a> and <a class="notranslate" href="#4trait solving">trait solving</a>.)</p>

<h2>Type collection</h2>
<br>
<p>Type &quot;collection&quot; is the process of converting the types found in the HIR
(<code>hir::Ty</code>), which represent the syntactic things that the user wrote, into the
<b>internal representation</b> used by the compiler (<code>Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;</code>) – we also do
similar conversions for where-clauses and other bits of the function signature.</p>
<br>
<p>To try and get a sense for the difference, consider this function:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust,ignore"><div data-l="struct Foo { }"></div><div data-l="fn foo(x: Foo, y: self::Foo) { ... }"></div><div data-l="#//        ^^^     ^^^^^^^^^"></div><div data-l="// ">       ^^^     ^^^^^^^^^</div></div>
<br>
<p>Those two parameters <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> each have the same type: but they will have
distinct <code>hir::Ty</code> nodes. Those nodes will have different spans, and of course
they encode the path somewhat differently. But once they are &quot;collected&quot; into
<code>Ty&lt;'tcx&gt;</code> nodes, they will be represented by the exact same internal type.</p>
<br>
<p>Collection is defined as a bundle of <a class="notranslate" href="#4queries">queries</a> for computing information about
the various functions, traits, and other items in the crate being compiled.
Note that each of these queries is concerned with <i>interprocedural</i> things –
for example, for a function definition, collection will figure out the type and
signature of the function, but it will not visit the <i>body</i> of the function in
any way, nor examine type annotations on local variables (that's the job of
type <i>checking</i>).</p>
