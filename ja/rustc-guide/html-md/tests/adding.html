<h1>Adding new tests</h1>
<br>
<p><b>In general, we expect every PR that fixes a bug in rustc to come
accompanied by a regression test of some kind.</b> This test should fail
in master but pass after the PR. These tests are really useful for
preventing us from repeating the mistakes of the past.</p>
<br>
<p>To add a new test, the first thing you generally do is to create a
file, typically a Rust source file. Test files have a particular
structure:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="-">They always begin with the <a href="#2./conventions.html#copyright">copyright notice</a>;</div>
<div data-b="-">then they should have some kind of
<a href="#2#explanatory_comment">comment explaining what the test is about</a>;</div>
<div data-b="-">next, they can have one or more <a href="#2#header_commands">header commands</a>, which
are special comments that the test interpreter knows how to interpret.</div>
<div data-b="-">finally, they have the Rust source. This may have various <a href="#2#error_annotations">error
  annotations</a> which indicate expected compilation errors or
warnings.</div>
<br>
<p>Depending on the test suite, there may be some other details to be aware of:
  - For <a href="#2#ui">the <code>ui</code> test suite</a>, you need to generate reference output files.</p>
<br>
<h2>What kind of test should I add?</h2>
<br>
<p>It can be difficult to know what kind of test to use. Here are some
rough heuristics:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="-">Some tests have specialized needs:</div>
<div data-b="  -">need to run gdb or lldb? use the <code>debuginfo</code> test suite</div>
<div data-b="  -">need to inspect LLVM IR or MIR IR? use the <code>codegen</code> or <code>mir-opt</code> test
suites</div>
<div data-b="  -">need to run rustdoc? Prefer a <code>rustdoc</code> test</div>
<div data-b="  -">need to inspect the resulting binary in some way? Then use <code>run-make</code></div>
<div data-b="-">For most other things, <a href="#2#ui">a <code>ui</code> (or <code>ui-fulldeps</code>) test</a> is to be
preferred:</div>
<div data-b="  -"><code>ui</code> tests subsume both run-pass, compile-fail, and parse-fail tests</div>
<div data-b="  -">in the case of warnings or errors, <code>ui</code> tests capture the full output,
which makes it easier to review but also helps prevent &quot;hidden&quot; regressions
in the output</div>
<br>
<h2>Naming your test</h2>
<br>
<p>We have not traditionally had a lot of structure in the names of
tests.  Moreover, for a long time, the rustc test runner did not
support subdirectories (it now does), so test suites like
<a class="notranslate" href="#4`src/test/run-pass`">`src/test/run-pass`</a> have a huge mess of files in them. This is not
considered an ideal setup.</p>
<br>
<a class="notranslate" href="#1https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/test/run-pass/">`src/test/run-pass`</a>
<br>
<p>For regression tests – basically, some random snippet of code that
came in from the internet – we often just name the test after the
issue. For example, <code>src/test/run-pass/issue-12345.rs</code>. If possible,
though, it is better if you can put the test into a directory that
helps identify what piece of code is being tested here (e.g.,
<code>borrowck/issue-12345.rs</code> is much better), or perhaps give it a more
meaningful name. Still, <b>do include the issue number somewhere</b>.</p>
<br>
<p>When writing a new feature, <b>create a subdirectory to store your
tests</b>. For example, if you are implementing RFC 1234 (&quot;Widgets&quot;),
then it might make sense to put the tests in directories like:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="-"><code>src/test/ui/rfc1234-widgets/</code></div>
<div data-b="-"><code>src/test/run-pass/rfc1234-widgets/</code></div>
<div data-b="-">etc</div>
<br>
<p>In other cases, there may already be a suitable directory. (The proper
directory structure to use is actually an area of active debate.)</p>
<br>
<p><a name="explanatory_comment"></a></p>
<br>
<h2>Comment explaining what the test is about</h2>
<br>
<p>When you create a test file, <b>include a comment summarizing the point
of the test immediately after the copyright notice</b>. This should
highlight which parts of the test are more important, and what the bug
was that the test is fixing.  Citing an issue number is often very
helpful.</p>
<br>
<p>This comment doesn't have to be super extensive. Just something like
&quot;Regression test for #18060: match arms were matching in the wrong
order.&quot;  might already be enough.</p>
<br>
<p>These comments are very useful to others later on when your test
breaks, since they often can highlight what the problem is. They are
also useful if for some reason the tests need to be refactored, since
they let others know which parts of the test were important (often a
test must be rewritten because it no longer tests what is was meant to
test, and then it's useful to know what it <i>was</i> meant to test
exactly).</p>
<br>
<p><a name="header_commands"></a></p>
<br>
<h2>Header commands: configuring rustc</h2>
<br>
<p>Header commands are special comments that the test runner knows how to
interpret.  They must appear before the Rust source in the test. They
are normally put after the short comment that explains the point of
this test. For example, this test uses the <code>// compile-flags</code> command
to specify a custom flag to give to rustc when the test is compiled:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust,ignore"><div data-l="#// Copyright 2017 The Rust Project Developers. blah blah blah."></div><div data-l="#// ..."></div><div data-l="#// except according to those terms."></div><div data-l="// ">Copyright 2017 The Rust Project Developers. blah blah blah. ... except according to those terms.</div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="#// Test the behavior of `0 - 1` when overflow checks are disabled."></div><div data-l="// ">Test the behavior of <code>0 - 1</code> when overflow checks are disabled.</div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="#// compile-flags: -Coverflow-checks=off"></div><div data-l="// ">compile-flags: -Coverflow-checks=off</div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="fn main() {"></div><div data-l="    let x = 0 - 1;"></div><div data-l="    ..."></div><div data-l="}"></div></div>
<br>
<h3>Ignoring tests</h3>
<br>
<p>These are used to ignore the test in some situations, which means the test won't
be compiled or run.</p>
<br>
<div data-b="*"><code>ignore-X</code> where <code>X</code> is a target detail or stage will ignore the
test accordingly (see below)</div>
<div data-b="*"><code>only-X</code> is like <code>ignore-X</code>, but will <i>only</i> run the test on that
target or stage</div>
<div data-b="*"><code>ignore-pretty</code> will not compile the pretty-printed test (this is
done to test the pretty-printer, but might not always work)</div>
<div data-b="*"><code>ignore-test</code> always ignores the test</div>
<div data-b="*"><code>ignore-lldb</code> and <code>ignore-gdb</code> will skip a debuginfo test on that
debugger.</div>
<br>
<p>Some examples of <code>X</code> in <code>ignore-X</code>:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="*">Architecture: <code>aarch64</code>, <code>arm</code>, <code>asmjs</code>, <code>mips</code>, <code>wasm32</code>, <code>x86_64</code>,
<code>x86</code>, ...</div>
<div data-b="*">OS: <code>android</code>, <code>emscripten</code>, <code>freebsd</code>, <code>ios</code>, <code>linux</code>, <code>macos</code>,
<code>windows</code>, ...</div>
<div data-b="*">Environment (fourth word of the target triple): <code>gnu</code>, <code>msvc</code>,
<code>musl</code>.</div>
<div data-b="*">Pointer width: <code>32bit</code>, <code>64bit</code>.</div>
<div data-b="*">Stage: <code>stage0</code>, <code>stage1</code>, <code>stage2</code>.</div>
<br>
<h3>Other Header Commands</h3>
<br>
<p>Here is a list of other header commands. This list is not
exhaustive. Header commands can generally be found by browsing the
<code>TestProps</code> structure found in <a class="notranslate" href="#4`header.rs`">`header.rs`</a> from the compiletest
source.</p>
<br>
<div data-b="*"><code>run-rustfix</code> for UI tests, indicates that the test produces
structured suggestions. The test writer should create a <code>.fixed</code>
file, which contains the source with the suggestions applied.
When the test is run, compiletest first checks that the correct
lint/warning is generated. Then, it applies the suggestion and
compares against <code>.fixed</code> (they must match). Finally, the fixed
source is compiled, and this compilation is required to succeed.
The <code>.fixed</code> file can also be generated automatically with the
<code>--bless</code> option, discussed <a class="notranslate" href="#2#bless">below</a>.</div>
<div data-b="*"><code>min-{gdb,lldb}-version</code></div>
<div data-b="*"><code>min-llvm-version</code></div>
<div data-b="*"><code>compile-pass</code> for UI tests, indicates that the test is
supposed to compile, as opposed to the default where the test is
supposed to error out.</div>
<div data-b="*"><code>compile-flags</code> passes extra command-line args to the compiler,
e.g. <code>compile-flags -g</code> which forces debuginfo to be enabled.</div>
<div data-b="*"><code>should-fail</code> indicates that the test should fail; used for &quot;meta
testing&quot;, where we test the compiletest program itself to check that
it will generate errors in appropriate scenarios. This header is
ignored for pretty-printer tests.</div>
<div data-b="*"><code>gate-test-X</code> where <code>X</code> is a feature marks the test as &quot;gate test&quot;
for feature X.  Such tests are supposed to ensure that the compiler
errors when usage of a gated feature is attempted without the proper
<code>#€[feature(X)]</code> tag.  Each unstable lang feature is required to
have a gate test.</div>
<br>
<a class="notranslate" href="#1https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/tree/master/src/tools/compiletest/src/header.rs">`header.rs`</a>
<br>
<p><a name="error_annotations"></a></p>
<br>
<h2>Error annotations</h2>
<br>
<p>Error annotations specify the errors that the compiler is expected to
emit. They are &quot;attached&quot; to the line in source where the error is
located.</p>
<br>
<div data-b="*"><code>~</code>: Associates the following error level and message with the
current line</div>
<div data-b="*"><code>~|</code>: Associates the following error level and message with the same
line as the previous comment</div>
<div data-b="*"><code>~^</code>: Associates the following error level and message with the
previous line. Each caret (<code>^</code>) that you add adds a line to this, so
<code>~^^^^^^^</code> is seven lines up.</div>
<br>
<p>The error levels that you can have are:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="1."><code>ERROR</code></div>
<div data-b="2."><code>WARNING</code></div>
<div data-b="3."><code>NOTE</code></div>
<div data-b="4."><code>HELP</code> and <code>SUGGESTION</code><i>

\</i> <b>Note</b>: <code>SUGGESTION</code> must follow immediately after <code>HELP</code>.</div>
<br>
<h2>Revisions</h2>
<br>
<p>Certain classes of tests support &quot;revisions&quot; (as of the time of this
writing, this includes run-pass, compile-fail, run-fail, and
incremental, though incremental tests are somewhat
different). Revisions allow a single test file to be used for multiple
tests. This is done by adding a special header at the top of the file:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="#// revisions: foo bar baz"></div><div data-l="// ">revisions: foo bar baz</div></div>
<br>
<p>This will result in the test being compiled (and tested) three times,
once with <code>--cfg foo</code>, once with <code>--cfg bar</code>, and once with <code>--cfg
baz</code>. You can therefore use <code>#[cfg(foo)]</code> etc within the test to tweak
each of these results.</p>
<br>
<p>You can also customize headers and expected error messages to a particular
revision. To do this, add <code>[foo]</code> (or <code>bar</code>, <code>baz</code>, etc) after the <code>//</code>
comment, like so:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="#// A flag to pass in only for cfg `foo`:"></div><div data-l="// ">A flag to pass in only for cfg <code>foo</code>:</div><div data-l="//[foo]compile-flags: -Z verbose"></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="#[cfg(foo)]"></div><div data-l="fn test_foo() {"></div><div data-l="    let x: usize = 32_u32; //[foo]~ ERROR mismatched types"></div><div data-l="}"></div></div>
<br>
<p>Note that not all headers have meaning when customized to a revision.
For example, the <code>ignore-test</code> header (and all &quot;ignore&quot; headers)
currently only apply to the test as a whole, not to particular
revisions. The only headers that are intended to really work when
customized to a revision are error patterns and compiler flags.</p>

<br>
<h2>Guide to the UI tests</h2>
<br>
<p>The UI tests are intended to capture the compiler's complete output,
so that we can test all aspects of the presentation. They work by
compiling a file (e.g., <a class="notranslate" href="#3hw-main"><code>ui/hello_world/main.rs</code></a>),
capturing the output, and then applying some normalization (see
below). This normalized result is then compared against reference
files named <code>ui/hello_world/main.stderr</code> and
<code>ui/hello_world/main.stdout</code>. If either of those files doesn't exist,
the output must be empty (that is actually the case for
<a href="#3hw">this particular test</a>). If the test run fails, we will print out
the current output, but it is also saved in
<code>build/&lt;target-triple&gt;/test/ui/hello_world/main.stdout</code> (this path is
printed as part of the test failure message), so you can run <code>diff</code>
and so forth.</p>
<br>

<a class="notranslate" href="#1https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/ui/hello_world/">hw</a>
<br>
<h3>Tests that do not result in compile errors</h3>
<br>
<p>By default, a UI test is expected <b>not to compile</b> (in which case,
it should contain at least one <code>//~ ERROR</code> annotation). However, you
can also make UI tests where compilation is expected to succeed, and
you can even run the resulting program. Just add one of the following
<a href="#2#header_commands">header commands</a>:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="-"><code>// compile-pass</code> – compilation should succeed but do
not run the resulting binary</div>
<div data-b="-"><code>// run-pass</code> – compilation should succeed and we should run the
resulting binary</div>
<br>
<p><a name="bless"></a></p>
<br>
<h3>Editing and updating the reference files</h3>
<br>
<p>If you have changed the compiler's output intentionally, or you are
making a new test, you can pass <code>--bless</code> to the test subcommand. E.g.
if some tests in <code>src/test/ui</code> are failing, you can run</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="text"><div data-l="./x.py test --stage 1 src/test/ui --bless"></div></div>
<br>
<p>to automatically adjust the <code>.stderr</code>, <code>.stdout</code> or <code>.fixed</code> files of
all tests. Of course you can also target just specific tests with the
<code>--test-args your_test_name</code> flag, just like when running the tests.</p>
<br>
<h3>Normalization</h3>
<br>
<p>The normalization applied is aimed at eliminating output difference
between platforms, mainly about filenames:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="-">the test directory is replaced with <code>$DIR</code></div>
<div data-b="-">all backslashes (<code>\</code>) are converted to forward slashes (<code>/</code>) (for Windows)</div>
<div data-b="-">all CR LF newlines are converted to LF</div>
<br>
<p>Sometimes these built-in normalizations are not enough. In such cases, you
may provide custom normalization rules using the header commands, e.g.</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust"><div data-l="#// normalize-stdout-test: &quot;foo&quot; -&gt; &quot;bar&quot;"></div><div data-l="#// normalize-stderr-32bit: &quot;fn\(\) \(32 bits\)&quot; -&gt; &quot;fn\(\) \($$PTR bits\)&quot;"></div><div data-l="#// normalize-stderr-64bit: &quot;fn\(\) \(64 bits\)&quot; -&gt; &quot;fn\(\) \($$PTR bits\)&quot;"></div><div data-l="// ">normalize-stdout-test: &quot;foo&quot; -&gt; &quot;bar&quot; normalize-stderr-32bit: &quot;fn\(\) \(32 bits\)&quot; -&gt; &quot;fn\(\) \($$PTR bits\)&quot; normalize-stderr-64bit: &quot;fn\(\) \(64 bits\)&quot; -&gt; &quot;fn\(\) \($$PTR bits\)&quot;</div></div>
<br>
<p>This tells the test, on 32-bit platforms, whenever the compiler writes
<code>fn() (32 bits)</code> to stderr, it should be normalized to read <code>fn() ($PTR bits)</code>
instead. Similar for 64-bit. The replacement is performed by regexes using
default regex flavor provided by <code>regex</code> crate.</p>
<br>
<p>The corresponding reference file will use the normalized output to test both
32-bit and 64-bit platforms:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="text"><div data-l="..."></div><div data-l="   |"></div><div data-l="   = note: source type: fn() ($PTR bits)"></div><div data-l="   = note: target type: u16 (16 bits)"></div><div data-l="..."></div></div>
<br>
<p>Please see <a class="notranslate" href="#3mrs"><code>ui/transmute/main.rs</code></a> and <a class="notranslate" href="#3"><code>main.stderr</code></a> for a
concrete usage example.</p>
<br>
<a class="notranslate" href="#1https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/ui/transmute/main.rs">mrs</a>
<a class="notranslate" href="#1https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/master/src/test/ui/transmute/main.stderr">`main.stderr`</a>
<br>
<p>Besides <code>normalize-stderr-32bit</code> and <code>-64bit</code>, one may use any target
information or stage supported by <code>ignore-X</code> here as well (e.g.
<code>normalize-stderr-windows</code> or simply <code>normalize-stderr-test</code> for unconditional
replacement).</p>
