<h1>MIR borrow check</h1>
<br>
<p>The borrow check is Rust's &quot;secret sauce&quot; – it is tasked with
enforcing a number of properties:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="-">That all variables are initialized before they are used.</div>
<div data-b="-">That you can't move the same value twice.</div>
<div data-b="-">That you can't move a value while it is borrowed.</div>
<div data-b="-">That you can't access a place while it is mutably borrowed (except through
the reference).</div>
<div data-b="-">That you can't mutate a place while it is shared borrowed.</div>
<div data-b="-">etc</div>
<br>
<p>At the time of this writing, the code is in a state of transition. The
&quot;main&quot; borrow checker still works by processing <a href="#2hir.html">the HIR</a>,
but that is being phased out in favor of the MIR-based borrow checker.
Doing borrow checking on MIR has two key advantages:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="-">The MIR is <i>far</i> less complex than the HIR; the radical desugaring
helps prevent bugs in the borrow checker. (If you're curious, you
can see
<a href="#347366">a list of bugs that the MIR-based borrow checker fixes here</a>.)</div>
<div data-b="-">Even more importantly, using the MIR enables <a href="#3nll">&quot;non-lexical lifetimes&quot;</a>,
which are regions derived from the control-flow graph.</div>

<h3>Major phases of the borrow checker</h3>
<br>
<p>The borrow checker source is found in
<a href="#3b_c">the <code>rustc_mir::borrow_check</code> module</a>. The main entry point is
the <code>mir_borrowck</code> query. At the time of this writing, MIR borrowck can operate
in several modes, but this text will describe only the mode when NLL is enabled
(what you get with <code>#€[feature(nll)]</code>).</p>

<br>
<p>The overall flow of the borrow checker is as follows:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="-">We first create a <b>local copy</b> C of the MIR. In the coming steps,
we will modify this copy in place to modify the types and things to
include references to the new regions that we are computing.</div>
<div data-b="-">We then invoke <code>nll::replace_regions_in_mir</code> to modify this copy C.
Among other things, this function will replace all of the regions in
the MIR with fresh <a href="#2./appendix/glossary.html">inference variables</a>.</div>
<div data-b="  -">(More details can be found in <a href="#2./mir/regionck.html">the regionck section</a>.)</div>
<div data-b="-">Next, we perform a number of <a href="#2./appendix/background.html#dataflow">dataflow
  analyses</a>
that compute what data is moved and when. The results of these analyses
are needed to do both borrow checking and region inference.</div>
<div data-b="-">Using the move data, we can then compute the values of all the regions in the
MIR.</div>
<div data-b="  -">(More details can be found in <a href="#2./mir/regionck.html">the NLL section</a>.)</div>
<div data-b="-">Finally, the borrow checker itself runs, taking as input (a) the
results of move analysis and (b) the regions computed by the region
checker. This allows us to figure out which loans are still in scope
at any particular point.</div>
