<h1>Introduction</h1>
<br>
<p>This document is the primary reference for the Rust programming language. It
provides three kinds of material:</p>
<br>
<div data-b="  -">Chapters that informally describe each language construct and their use.</div>
<div data-b="  -">Chapters that informally describe the memory model, concurrency model,
runtime services, linkage model and debugging facilities.</div>
<div data-b="  -">Appendix chapters providing rationale and references to languages that
influenced the design.</div>
<br>
<p>This document does not serve as an introduction to the language. Background
familiarity with the language is assumed. A separate <a class="notranslate" href="#4book">book</a> is available to
help acquire such background familiarity.</p>
<br>
<p>This document also does not serve as a reference to the <a class="notranslate" href="#4standard">standard</a> library
included in the language distribution. Those libraries are documented
separately by extracting documentation attributes from their source code. Many
of the features that one might expect to be language features are library
features in Rust, so what you're looking for may be there, not here.</p>
<br>
<p>This document also only serves as a reference to what is available in stable
Rust. For unstable features being worked on, see the <a class="notranslate" href="#4Unstable Book">Unstable Book</a>. This was
a recent change in scope, so unstable features are still documented, but are
in the process of being removed.</p>
<br>
<p>Finally, this document is not normative. It may include details that are
specific to <code>rustc</code> itself, and should not be taken as a specification for
the Rust language. We intend to produce such a document someday, but this
is what we have for now.</p>
<br>
<p>You may also be interested in the <a class="notranslate" href="#4grammar">grammar</a>.</p>

<p>You can contribute to this document by opening an issue or sending a pull
request to <a class="notranslate" href="#4the Rust Reference repository">the Rust Reference repository</a>.</p>
<br>
<p>N. B. This document may be incomplete. Documenting everything might take a
while. We have a <a class="notranslate" href="#4big issue">big issue</a> to track documentation for every Rust feature,
so check that out if you can't find something here.</p>
