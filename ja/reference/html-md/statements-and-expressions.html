<h1>Statements and expressions</h1>
<br>
<p>Rust is <s>primarily</s> an expression language. This means that most forms of
value-producing or effect-causing evaluation are directed by the uniform syntax
category of <s>expressions</s>. Each kind of expression can typically <s>nest</s> within
each other kind of expression, and rules for evaluation of expressions involve
specifying both the value produced by the expression and the order in which its
sub-expressions are themselves evaluated.</p>
<br>
<p>In contrast, statements in Rust serve <s>mostly</s> to contain and explicitly
sequence expression evaluation.</p>
