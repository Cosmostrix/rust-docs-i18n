<h1>Memory model</h1>
<br>
<p>A Rust program's memory consists of a static set of <i>items</i> and a <i>heap</i>.
Immutable portions of the heap may be safely shared between threads, mutable
portions may not be safely shared, but several mechanisms for effectively-safe
sharing of mutable values, built on unsafe code but enforcing a safe locking
discipline, exist in the standard library.</p>
<br>
<p>Allocations in the stack consist of <i>variables</i>, and allocations in the heap
consist of <i>boxes</i>.</p>
