<h1>Default match bindings</h1>
<br>
<p>Have you ever had a borrowed <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> and tried to match on it? You
probably wrote this:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust,ignore"><div data-l="let s: &amp;Option&lt;String&gt; = &amp;Some(&quot;hello&quot;.to_string());"></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="match s {"></div><div data-l="    Some(s) =&gt; println!(&quot;s is: {}&quot;, s),"></div><div data-l="    _ =&gt; (),"></div><div data-l="};"></div></div>
<br>
<p>In Rust 2015, this would fail to compile, and you would have to write the following instead:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust,ignore"><div data-l="#// Rust 2015"></div><div data-l="// ">Rust 2015</div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="let s: &amp;Option&lt;String&gt; = &amp;Some(&quot;hello&quot;.to_string());"></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="match s {"></div><div data-l="    &amp;Some(ref s) =&gt; println!(&quot;s is: {}&quot;, s),"></div><div data-l="    _ =&gt; (),"></div><div data-l="};"></div></div>
<br>
<p>Rust 2018, by contrast, will infer the <code>&amp;</code>s and <code>ref</code>s, and your original code will Just Work.</p>
<br>
<p>This affects not just <code>match</code>, but patterns everywhere, such as in <code>let</code> statements,
closure arguments, and <code>for</code> loops.</p>
<br>
<h2>More details</h2>
<br>
<p>The mental model of patterns has shifted a bit with this change, to bring it into
line with other aspects of the language. For example, when writing a <code>for</code> loop,
you can iterate over borrowed contents of a collection by borrowing the collection
itself:</p>
<br>
<div data-lang="rust,ignore"><div data-l="let my_vec: Vec&lt;i32&gt; = vec![0, 1, 2];"></div><div data-l=""></div><div data-l="for x in &amp;my_vec { ... }"></div></div>
<br>
<p>The idea is that an <code>&amp;T</code> can be understood as a <i>borrowed view of `T`</i>, and so
when you iterate, match, or otherwise destructure a <code>&amp;T</code> you get a borrowed view
of its internals as well.</p>
<br>
<p>More formally, patterns have a &quot;binding mode,&quot; which is either by value (<code>x</code>),
by reference (<code>ref x</code>), or by mutable reference (<code>ref mut x</code>).
In Rust 2015, <code>match</code> always started in by-value mode, and required you
to explicitly write <code>ref</code> or <code>ref mut</code> in patterns to switch to a borrowing
mode. In Rust 2018, the type of the value being matched informs the binding
mode, so that if you match against an <code>&amp;Option&lt;String&gt;</code> with a <code>Some</code> variant, you
are put into <code>ref</code> mode automatically, giving you a borrowed view of the
internal data. Similarly, <code>&amp;mut Option&lt;String&gt;</code> would give you a <code>ref mut</code> view.</p>
